Seiden\\nClient Alerts/Reports October 2022\\nRecipients of an erroneous $500 million wire transfer that had the financial world buzzing must return the\\nfunds, a U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit panel held on Sept. 8, reversing a New York federal\\ndistrict court ruling.\\nIn 2020, Citibank N.A. erroneously transmitted the funds to loan managers for certain lenders on a $1.8\\nbillion seven-year syndicated loan to Revlon Inc. The $500 million error paid off Revlon\\u2019s outstanding\\nprincipal balance three years before the company\\u2019s loan repayment was due. Citibank, the administrative\\nagent for the lenders, asked the lenders to return the funds. While a number of the lenders participating in\\nthe syndicate did return the funds received upon Citibank\\u2019s request, some refused. In a suit filed by\\nCitibank to seek the return of the erroneous payments, the district court ruled that the lenders did not\\nneed to return the money\\u2014a ruling that caused great concern within the financial community. As a\\nconsequence, administrative agents and the lawyers representing them began including in credit\\nagreements express \\u201cerroneous payment\\u201d language, which required lenders to return erroneous\\npayments to the administrative agent.\\nRecently, the Second Circuit determined that the lower court erred in deciding the loan managers did not\\nhave to return the money. The \\u201cdischarge-for-value\\u201d rule did not in fact shield the loan managers from\\nCitibank\\u2019s restitution claims because they were on inquiry notice of the mistake, wrote Judge Pierre N.\\nLeval in an opinion joined by Judges Robert D. Sack and Michael H. Park. Judge Park also wrote a\\nseparate concurrence.\\u00a0\\nThe circumstances around the erroneous transfer showed red warning flags that would have prompted \\u201ca\\nreasonably prudent person\\u201d who faced an avoidable risk of loss to look into whether the transfer resulted\\nfrom a mistake. Further, a reasonable inquiry would have revealed the mistake, said the panel.\\n3/7/25, 1:48 PM\\nSecond Circuit Reverses Ruling, Says Mistaken $500 Million Wire Transfer Paying Off Revlon Loan Must Be Returned | Loeb & Loeb\\u2026\\nhttps://www.loeb.com/en/insights/publications/2022/10/second-circuit-reverses-ruling-500-million-wire-transfer-paying-off-revlon-loan-returned\\n1/6\"\n",

The transaction occurred at a time when, because Revlon was insolvent, loan\\nparticipations were trading at 20% to 30% of the face amount. (Revlon later filed for Chapter 11\\nbankruptcy, on June 15, 2022.)\\nCitibank discovered the erroneous transmission the next day and issued a total of four recall notices over\\nthe next few days, requesting that the loan managers return the portion representing the principal.\\nHowever, certain loan managers, representing $500 million in debt, refused to return the funds.\\nDischarge-for-Value Rule\\nCitibank sued those loan managers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.\\nFollowing a bench trial, the district court concluded that the rule of discharge-for-value protected the loan\\nmanagers from Citibank\\u2019s restitution suit, relying on Banque Worms v. BankAmerica International.\\u00a0\\nIn Banque Worms, the New York Court of Appeals upheld a lender\\u2019s right to retain a bank\\u2019s mistaken\\nrepayment to the bank\\u2019s client of a loan that was due and payable. The Court of Appeals based its ruling\\non the American Law Institute\\u2019s discharge-for-value rule, published at Section 14 of the Restatement\\n(First) of Restitution (Am. Law Inst. 1937). The discharge-for-value rule outlines circumstances that excuse\\nthe recipient of a payment mistakenly made in discharge of a debt due, from the obligation to return the\\nmistaken payment.\\nThe district court ruled that the loan managers were entitled to keep the funds that Citibank had\\n3/7/25, 1:48 PM\\nSecond Circuit Reverses Ruling, Says Mistaken $500 Million Wire Transfer Paying Off Revlon Loan Must Be Returned | Loeb & Loeb\\u2026\\nhttps://www.loeb.com/en/insights/publications/2022/10/second-circuit-reverses-ruling-500-million-wire-transfer-paying-off-revlon-loan-returned\\n2/6\"\n",

It concluded that the defendants established the elements of the discharge-for-value\\ndefense because (1) the lenders were creditors of Revlon on the date of the mistaken payment, (2) each\\nlender was owed in principal and interest the exact amount of money it received from Citibank, (3) neither\\nthe lenders nor the loan managers made misrepresentations to induce the mistaken wire transfers, and\\n(4) neither the lenders nor the loan managers were on notice of Citibank\\u2019s mistake.\\nOn appeal to the Second Circuit, Citibank raised several arguments challenging the discharge-for-value\\nrule and the applicability of Banque Worms to this case.\\nConstructive Notice\\nCitibank argued the loan managers could not claim the benefit of the discharge-for-value rule because\\nthey were on notice of a mistake.\\nThe panel agreed. Under New York law, the discharge-for-value rule does not shield the beneficiary of a\\nmistaken transfer from claims for restitution if the beneficiary is on inquiry notice of the mistake. Further,\\nbased on the facts available to the loan managers on Aug. 11, the standard of inquiry notice was satisfied.\\n\\u201cThe facts were sufficiently troublesome that a reasonably prudent investor would have made reasonable\\ninquiry and reasonable inquiry would have revealed that the payment was made in error,\\u201d the panel\\nwrote.\\u00a0\\nThe loan managers were aware of four red warning flags that suggested a mistake:\\na. The absence of prior notice of a prepayment, to which the lenders were contractually entitled.\\nb. The inability of the insolvent Revlon to make a repayment of close to $1 billion.\\nc. The fact that the loan was trading at 20 to 30 cents on the dollar, so it could have been retired far more\\ncheaply than by paying its full value.\\nd. Revlon\\u2019s attempt just four days earlier to avoid acceleration of the loan\\u2019s maturity by making an\\nexchange offer to holders of the 2021 notes.\\nFurther, the district court\\u2019s ruling depended on its factual findings that the loan managers believed in\\ngood faith that the payments they received were not a mistake and on its conclusion that those beliefs\\nwere reasonable. The panel said the district court\\u2019s reasoning represented a misunderstanding of the\\ninquiry notice test.\\n\\u201cThe test is not whether the recipient of the mistaken payment reasonably believed that the payment was\\ngenuine and not the result of mistake.

In this case, calling Citibank would have been an easy\\nand obvious way to confirm any suspicion that the wire transfer payment was a mistake. A loan manager\\nwho failed to call Citibank or Revlon but relied instead on nothing more than confirming that the payment\\nmatched the debt did not conduct a reasonable investigation, the panel said.\\u00a0\\nHaving failed to make those calls, the loan managers were chargeable with notice of what they would\\nhave learned. Therefore, the panel concluded, the loan managers were on notice of Citibank\\u2019s mistake and\\nwere thus ineligible to claim the discharge-for-value defense.\\nBanque Worms Ruling\\nThe panel also agreed with Citibank\\u2019s contention that the loan managers were not protected by the\\nBanque Worms ruling because on Aug. 11, they were not entitled to the money they received from\\nCitibank, since Revlon\\u2019s debt was not yet payable.\\nThe plaintiff in Banque Worms was entitled to the money because the loan at issue was payable and the\\ndefendant demanded payment. The loan in this case was not payable for three more years, the panel\\nexplained. The Banque Worms decision highlighted the finality of wire transfers, but it did not give a\\nhigher value to finality over all other values.\\u00a0\\nOn the contrary, the Banque Worms court explicitly left standing New York\\u2019s basic rule requiring the return\\nof the mistaken payments except where identified exceptions apply. It also provided exceptions to the\\ndenial of restitution based on factors such as when the transferee made misrepresentations or had notice\\nof the mistake, said the panel.\\nAdditional Comments\\nJudge Leval wrote an addendum to the opinion, questioning whether an accidental payment of the kind\\nmade by Citibank comes within the scope of the Restatement\\u2019s discharge-for-value rule.\\u00a0\\nThe Restatement rule applies in circumstances where the transferor\\u2019s payment resulted from his \\u201cmistake\\n. . . as to his interests or duties.\\u201d Citibank was not mistaken as to its interests or duties. Its only mistake\\nwas making a wire transfer setting error, said Judge Leval. Therefore, the discharge-for-value rule has no\\napplication to the payment made in this case, which was an accidental payment made without intent to\\npay, without intent to discharge a debt or lien and without mistake as to the transferor\\u2019s duties or\\ninterests, he said.\\u00a0\\n3/7/25, 1:48 PM\\nSecond Circuit Reverses Ruling, Says Mistaken $500 Million Wire Transfer Paying Off Revlon Loan Must Be Returned | Loeb & Loeb\\u2026\\nhttps://www.loeb.com/en/insights/publications/2022/10/second-circuit-reverses-ruling-500-million-wire-transfer-paying-off-revlon-loan-returned\\n4/6\"\n",

Revlon is an\\nindirect majority-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated (together with certain of its affiliates other than the\\nCompany, \\\"MacAndrews & Forbes\\\"), a corporation beneficially owned by Ronald O. Perelman. Mr. Perelman is Chairman of Revlon's\\nand Products Corporation's Board of Directors.\\nThe Company was founded over 88 years ago by Charles Revson, who revolutionized the cosmetics industry by introducing nail\\nenamels matched to lipsticks in fashion colors. Today, the Company continues Revson's legacy by producing and marketing innovative\\nproducts that address consumers' wants and needs for beauty and personal care products.\\nThe Company is a leading global beauty company with an iconic portfolio of brands. The Company develops, manufactures,\\nmarkets, distributes and sells worldwide an extensive array of beauty and personal care products, including color cosmetics, hair color,\\nhair care and hair treatments, fragrances, skin care, beauty tools, men\\u2019s grooming products, anti-perspirant deodorants and other beauty\\ncare products across a variety of distribution channels. The Company is entrepreneurial, agile and boldly creative, with a passion for\\nbeauty. The Company has a diverse portfolio of iconic brands that it continues to evolve and transform, with the goal of inspiring and\\nattracting consumers around the world wherever and however they shop for beauty. The Company is committed to operating as an\\nethical business and driving sustainable and responsible growth.\\nBusiness Strategy\\nThe Company remains focused on its 3 key strategic pillars to drive its future success and growth.

This review is ongoing and remains focused on exploring potential options for the Company's\\nportfolio and regional brands (the \\u201cStrategic Review\\u201d).\\nFinancial Information about Operating Segments\\nOperating segments include components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated\\nregularly by the chief operating decision maker (the Company's \\\"Chief Executive Officer\\\") in deciding how to allocate resources and in\\nassessing the Company's performance. As a result of the similarities in the procurement, manufacturing and distribution processes for\\nthe Company\\u2019s products, much of the information provided in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and provided in the\\nsegment table below is similar to, or the same as, that reviewed on a regular basis by the Company's Chief Executive Officer.

In addition to products sold in large volume retailers,\\ndistributors, wholesalers, professional salons and demonstrator-assisted retailers, the Company's products also compete with products\\nsold in prestige and department stores, television shopping, door-to-door, specialty stores, one-stop shopping beauty retailers, e-\\ncommerce sites, perfumeries and other distribution outlets.

In addition, shares of the capital stock of Products Corporation, Revlon's wholly-owned operating subsidiary, are pledged\\nby Revlon to secure its obligations under the 2016 Credit Agreements and the 2019 Term Loan Facility.\\nRevlon is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Revlon's only material asset is all of the outstanding capital\\nstock of Products Corporation, Revlon's wholly-owned operating subsidiary, through which Revlon conducts its business operations. As\\nsuch, Revlon's net income has historically consisted predominantly of its equity in the net loss of Products Corporation, which for 2019\\nand 2018 was $151.2\\u00a0million and $289.1\\u00a0million, respectively (in each case excluding $7.9\\u00a0million and $6.3\\u00a0million, respectively, in\\nexpenses primarily related to Revlon being a public holding company). Revlon is dependent on the earnings and cash flow of, and\\ndividends and distributions from, Products Corporation to pay Revlon\\u2019s expenses incidental to being a public holding company and to\\npay any cash dividend or distribution on its Class A Common Stock in each case that may be authorized by Revlon\\u2019s Board of\\nDirectors.\\nProducts Corporation may not generate sufficient cash flow to pay dividends or distribute funds to Revlon because, for example,\\nProducts Corporation may not generate sufficient cash or net income; state laws may restrict or prohibit Products Corporation from\\nissuing dividends or making distributions unless Products Corporation has sufficient surplus or net profits, which Products Corporation\\nmay not have; or because contractual restrictions, including negative covenants contained in Products Corporation\\u2019s various debt\\ninstruments, may prohibit or limit such dividends or distributions.\\nThe terms of Products Corporation's 2016 Credit Agreements, the indentures governing Products Corporation's 6.25% Senior\\nNotes due 2024 (the \\\"6.25% Senior Notes Indenture\\\" and the \\\"6.25% Senior Notes,\\\" respectively) and 5.75% Senior Notes due 2021\\n(the \\\"5.75% Senior Notes Indenture\\\" and the \\\"5.75% Senior Notes,\\\" respectively, and, together with the 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture,\\nthe \\\"Senior Notes Indentures\\\" and the \\\"Senior Notes,\\\" respectively) and the 2019 Term Loan Facility (as hereinafter defined) generally\\nrestrict Products Corporation from paying dividends or making distributions to Revlon, except in limited circumstances. For example,\\nProducts Corporation is permitted to pay dividends and make distributions to Revlon to enable Revlon to, among other things, maintain\\nits existence and its ownership of Products Corporation, such as paying professional fees (e.g., legal, accounting and insurance fees),\\nregulatory fees (e.g., SEC filing fees and NYSE listing fees), pay certain taxes and other expenses related to being a public holding\\ncompany and, subject to certain limitations, to pay dividends, if any, on Revlon\\u2019s outstanding securities or make distributions in certain\\ncircumstances to finance Revlon\\u2019s purchase of shares of its Class A Common Stock issued in connection with the delivery of such\\nshares to grantees under the Fourth Amended and Restated Revlon, Inc. Stock Plan, as amended. These limitations therefore restrict\\nRevlon's ability to pay dividends on its Class\\u00a0A Common Stock.\\nAll of the shares of Products Corporation\\u2019s capital stock held by Revlon are pledged to secure Revlon\\u2019s guarantee of Products\\nCorporation's obligations under its 2016 Credit Agreements and the 2019 Term Loan Facility. A foreclosure upon the shares of Products\\nCorporation's common stock would result in Revlon no longer holding its only material asset, would have a material adverse effect on\\nthe holders and price of Revlon\\u2019s Class A Common Stock and would be a change of control under Products Corporation\\u2019s other debt\\ninstruments.

While the Amended 2016\\nRevolving Credit Facility provides for up to $441.5 million of commitments, the Company\\u2019s ability to borrow funds under such facility\\nis limited by a borrowing base determined relative to the value, from time-to-time, of certain eligible assets.\\nWhile the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility provides for a euro-denominated senior secured asset-based term loan facility\\nin an aggregate principal amount of\\u00a0\\u20ac77 million, the full amount of which was funded on the closing of the facility in July 2018, the\\n2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement requires the maintenance of a borrowing base supporting the borrowing thereunder, based\\non the sum of: (i)\\u00a085%\\u00a0of eligible accounts receivable; and (ii)\\u00a090%\\u00a0of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory, in each\\ncase with respect to certain of Products Corporation\\u2019s subsidiaries organized in Australia, Bermuda, Germany, Italy, Spain and\\nSwitzerland, subject to certain customary availability reserves.\\nUnder the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility, if the value of the Company's\\neligible assets is not sufficient to support the full borrowing base under the respective facility, Products Corporation will not have\\ncomplete access to the entire commitment available under such facilities, but rather would have access to a lesser amount as determined\\nby the borrowing base.\\nThe Borrowers must prepay loans under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term\\nFacility to the extent that outstanding loans exceed its respective borrowing base Under the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility, in\\nlieu of a mandatory prepayment, the Loan Parties may deposit cash in an amount not to exceed\\u00a010%\\u00a0of the borrowing base into a\\ndesignated U.S. bank account with the Agent that is subject to a control agreement (such cash, the \\\"Qualified Cash\\\"). If any such over-\\nadvance has not been cured within 60 days, the Qualified Cash may be applied, at the Agent\\u2019s option, to prepay the loans under the\\n2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility. To the extent certain levels of availability are obtained during a certain period of time, the\\nBorrowers can withdraw the Qualified Cash from such bank account. In addition, the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility is\\nsubject to mandatory prepayments from the net proceeds from the incurrence by the Loan Parties of debt not permitted thereunder.\\nAs Products Corporation continues to manage its working capital (including its and its subsidiaries inventory and accounts\\nreceivable, which are significant components of the eligible assets comprising the borrowing base under the Amended 2016 Revolving\\nCredit Facility and the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility), this could reduce the borrowing base under the Amended 2016\\nRevolving Credit Facility and/or the 2018 Asset-Based Term Facility. Further, if Products Corporation borrows funds under the\\nAmended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, subsequent changes in the value or eligibility of the assets within the borrowing base could\\nrequire Products Corporation to pay down amounts outstanding under such facility so that there is no amount outstanding in excess of\\nthe then-existing borrowing base. Likewise, subsequent changes in the value or eligibility of the assets within the borrowing base under\\nthe 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility could require Products Corporation to pay down amounts outstanding under such facility\\nso that there is no amount outstanding in excess of the then-existing borrowing base, which, unlike the Amended 2016 Revolving\\nCredit Facility, cannot be re-borrowed.\\nThe Company\\u2019s ability to borrow under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility is also conditioned upon its compliance with\\nother covenants in the agreements that govern the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities. Because of these limitations, the Company may not\\nalways be able to meet its cash requirements with funds borrowed under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, which could\\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company\\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\\n15\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n26/245\"\n",

As of December\\u00a031, 2019, $2,253.6\\u00a0million of Products Corporation\\u2019s total indebtedness, or approximately 71% of its total\\nindebtedness, was subject to floating interest rates.\\nIn July 2017, the U.K.\\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or\\ncompelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. It is unclear whether or not LIBOR will cease to exist at that time (and if so, what\\nreference rate will replace it) or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021.\\nCertain of Products Corporation\\u2019s financing agreements, including its 2016 Term Loan Facility, the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit\\nFacility and the 2019 Term Loan Facility are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the applicable\\ninterest rate. While the 2016 Credit Agreements contain limited \\u201cfallback\\u201d provisions providing for comparable or successor rates in\\nthe event LIBOR is unavailable, these provisions may not adequately address the actual changes to LIBOR or its successor rates. For\\nexample, if future rates based upon the successor reference rate (or a new method of calculating LIBOR) are higher than LIBOR rates\\nas currently determined, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition\\nand/or cash flows. On the other hand, if future rates based upon the successor reference rate (or a new method of calculating LIBOR)\\nare lower than LIBOR rates as currently determined, the lenders under such credit agreements may seek amendments to increase the\\napplicable interest rate margins or invoke their right to require the use of the alternate base rate in place of LIBOR, which could result\\nin an increase to our interest expense as discussed below. By contrast, the 2019 Term Loan Facility does not have provisions for\\nselecting or requiring the alternative base rate, and therefore in the event that LIBOR is discontinued in the future and a comparable or\\nsuccessor rate is not approved by the required lenders under the 2019 Term Loan Facility, it may become necessary to amend the 2019\\nTerm Loan Facility. More generally, a phase-out of LIBOR could cause market volatility or disruption and may adversely affect our\\naccess to the capital markets and cost of funding, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of\\noperations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\\nSimilar considerations as the ones described above with respect to LIBOR as benchmark for establishing interest rates apply to\\nEURIBOR. Our 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility is denominated in Euros and the interest rate thereunder is tied to EURIBOR.\\nTo the extent that EURIBOR becomes unavailable, the agreement contains fallback provisions ultimately providing for a rate\\ndetermined by the administrative agent as the all-in-cost of funds for borrowings denominated in Euros with maturities comparable to\\nthe interest period applicable to the loans under the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility.\\n16\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n28/245\"\n",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nThe success of the Company's Fragrances segment depends, in part, on the demand for heritage and designer fragrance\\nproducts.\\u00a0A decrease in demand for such products, or the loss or infringement of any intellectual property rights, could have a\\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\\nThe Company's Fragrances segment has license agreements to manufacture, market and distribute a number of heritage and\\ndesigner fragrance products, including those of (i) Juicy Couture, John Varvatos and AllSaints in prestige fragrances; (ii) Britney\\nSpears, Christina Aguilera, Elizabeth Taylor, Jennifer Aniston and Mariah Carey in celebrity fragrances; and (iii) Ed Hardy,\\nLucky Brand and Geoffrey Beene in mass fragrances. In 2019, the Company's Fragrances segment derived approximately 60% of its\\nnet sales from heritage and designer fragrance brands. The demand for these products is, to some extent, dependent on the appeal to\\nconsumers of the particular designer or talent and the designer\\u2019s or talent\\u2019s reputation. The Company also cannot assure that the owners\\nof the trademarks that it licenses can or will successfully maintain their intellectual property rights. If other parties infringe on the\\nintellectual property rights that the Company licenses, the value of such brands in the marketplace may be diluted. To the extent that the\\nheritage or designer fragrance category or a particular designer or talent ceases to be appealing to consumers or a designer\\u2019s or talent\\u2019s\\nreputation is adversely affected, sales of the related products and the value of the impacted brands could decrease materially, which\\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company\\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\\nThe Company's inability to acquire or license additional fragrance brands or secure additional distribution arrangements and\\narrangements could have an adverse effect on the Company's net sales and a material adverse effect on the Company's business,\\nprospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\\nThe success of the Fragrances segment depends in part upon the continued growth of its portfolio of owned, licensed and\\ndistributed brands, including expanding its geographic presence to take advantage of opportunities in developed and emerging regions.\\nEfforts to increase sales of the Company's prestige fragrance portfolio and expand its geographic market presence depend upon a\\nnumber of factors, including its ability to:\\n\\u2022\\ndevelop its fragrance brand portfolio through branding, innovation and execution;\\n\\u2022\\nidentify and develop new and existing fragrance brands with the potential to become successful global brands;\\n\\u2022\\ninnovate and develop new fragrance products that are appealing to consumers;\\n\\u2022\\nacquire or license additional fragrance brands or secure additional distribution arrangements and the Company's ability to\\nobtain the required financing for these agreements and arrangements;\\n\\u2022\\nexpand the Company's geographic presence to take advantage of opportunities in developed and emerging regions;\\n\\u2022\\ncontinue to expand the Company's distribution channels within existing geographies to increase trade presence, brand\\nrecognition and sales;\\n\\u2022\\nexpand the Company's trade presence through alternative distribution channels, such as through e-commerce channels;\\n\\u2022\\nexpand margins through sales growth, the development of higher margin products and overhead and supply chain integration\\nand efficiency initiatives;\\n\\u2022\\neffectively manage capital investments and working capital to improve the generation of cash flow; and\\n\\u2022\\nexecute any acquisitions quickly and efficiently and integrate new businesses successfully.\\nThere can be no assurance that the Company can successfully achieve any or all of the above objectives in the manner or time\\nperiod that it expects. Further, achieving these objectives will require investments, which may result in material short-term costs\\nwithout generating any current net sales and the Company may not ultimately achieve its net sales objectives associated with such\\nefforts. The future expansion of the Fragrances segment through acquisitions, new fragrance licenses, e-commerce initiatives or other\\nnew fragrance distribution arrangements, if any, will depend upon the ability to identify suitable brands to acquire, license or distribute\\nand to obtain the required financing for these acquisitions, licenses or distribution arrangements or to launch or support the brands\\nassociated with these agreements or arrangements. The Company may not be able to identify, negotiate, finance or consummate such\\nacquisitions, licenses or arrangements on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. In addition, the Company may decide to divest or\\ndiscontinue certain brands or streamline operations and may incur costs and charges in doing so. The inability to acquire or license\\nadditional fragrance brands or secure additional distribution arrangements for the Fragrances segment (such as optimizing its e-\\ncommerce sales opportunities) and obtain the required financing for these agreements and arrangements could have an adverse effect\\non the Company\\u2019s net sales and a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and/or cash flows.\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n38/245\"\n",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nThe Company's foreign operations are subject to a variety of social, political and economic risks and have been, and are expected to\\ncontinue to be, affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations, foreign currency controls, government-mandated pricing\\ncontrols, duties, tariffs and/or other trade measures, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,\\nprospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows and the value of its foreign assets.\\nAs of December\\u00a031, 2019, the Company had operations based in 25 foreign countries and its products were sold in approximately\\n150 countries. The Company is exposed to risks associated with social, political and economic conditions, including inflation, inherent\\nin operating in foreign countries, including those in Asia (such as China and Hong Kong, which has been impacted by ongoing political\\nunrest in that region), Australia, Canada, Eastern Europe (such as Russia), Mexico, South Africa and South America (such as\\nArgentina), which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition\\nand/or cash flows. Such risks include hyperinflation, foreign currency devaluation, tariffs, foreign currency controls, government-\\nmandated pricing controls, currency remittance restrictions, changes in tax laws, changes in consumer purchasing habits (including as\\nto retailer preferences), as well as, to a lesser extent, changes in U.S. laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment.\\nThe U.S. and the other countries in which the Company\\u2019s products are manufactured or sold have imposed and may impose\\nadditional duties, tariffs and other retaliatory or trade protection measures, or other restrictions or regulations, or may adversely adjust\\nprevailing quota, duty or tariff levels, which can affect the cost and availability of materials that the Company uses to manufacture and\\npackage its products and the sale of finished products. For example, the E.U. has imposed tariffs on certain beauty products imported\\nfrom the U.S., which would impact the sale in the E.U. of certain of the Company\\u2019s more prestige products that are manufactured in the\\nU.S. Similarly, the tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods and materials from China would impact any materials that the Company\\nimports from that region for use in manufacturing or packaging in the U.S. Measures that the Company could be required to take to\\nreduce the impact of tariff increases or trade restrictions, including shifts of production among countries and manufacturers,\\ngeographical diversification of the Company\\u2019s sources of supply, adjustments in product or packaging design and fabrication, or\\nincreased prices, could increase the Company\\u2019s costs and delay the Company\\u2019s time to bring its products to shelf. Other governmental\\nactions related to tariffs or international trade agreements have the potential to adversely impact demand for the Company\\u2019s products,\\nproduction costs, retail customers and suppliers. These\\u00a0risks, which could increase the Company\\u2019s costs and reduce the Company\\u2019s net\\nsales and profitability, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and/or cash flows.\\nThese risks and limitations could also affect the ability of the Company's foreign subsidiaries to obtain sufficient capital to conduct\\ntheir operations in the ordinary course of business. Limitations and the difficulties that certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries\\nmay experience on the free flow of funds to and from these foreign subsidiaries could restrict the Company's ability to respond timely\\nto challenging business conditions or changes in operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,\\nprospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\\nThe Company's net sales outside of the U.S. for each of 2019 and 2018 represented approximately 53% and 52% of the Company's\\ntotal consolidated net sales, respectively. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected the Company's results of\\noperations and the value of the Company's foreign net assets in 2019 and they may adversely affect the Company's results of operations\\nand the value of the Company's foreign net assets in future periods, which in turn could cause a material adverse effect on the\\nCompany's reported net sales and earnings and the comparability of period-to-period results of operations.\\nProducts Corporation may, from time to time, enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge certain net cash\\nflows denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency forward exchange contracts may, from time to time, be entered into\\nprimarily for the purpose of hedging anticipated inventory purchases and certain intercompany payments denominated in foreign\\ncurrencies and generally have maturities of less than one year. At December\\u00a031, 2019, the notional amount of Products Corporation's\\nforeign currency forward exchange contracts was nil.

Such economic conditions have impacted, and could\\nin the future impact, business and consumer confidence, especially in relation to discretionary purchases. These conditions could have\\nan impact on customer and/or consumer purchases of the Company's products, which could result in a reduction of the Company's net\\nsales, operating income and/or cash flows. Additionally, disruptions in the credit and other financial markets and economic conditions\\ncould, among other things, impair the financial condition of one or more of the Company's customers or suppliers, thereby increasing\\nthe risk of customer bad debts or non-performance by suppliers. These conditions could have a material adverse effect on the\\nCompany's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\\nThe U.K.\\u2019s ongoing withdrawal process from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions,\\nfinancial markets and on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\\nThe Company is a multinational company with worldwide operations, including material business operations in Europe. In June\\n2016, a majority of voters in the U.K. elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum. In March 2017, the U.K.\\ngovernment invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union and the U.K. exited the European Union on January 31, 2020. The\\n\\\"Brexit\\\" process has created significant ongoing uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.K. and the European Union\\nand has given rise to calls for the governments of other European Union member states to consider withdrawal from the European\\nUnion. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse\\neffect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets and could significantly reduce global market liquidity\\nand restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Asset valuations, currency exchange rates and\\ncredit ratings may be especially subject to increased market volatility. Lack of clarity about future U.K. laws and regulations as the\\nU.K. determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate as the withdrawal process proceeds, including financial laws and\\nregulations, tax and free trade agreements, intellectual property rights, supply chain logistics, environmental, health and safety laws and\\nregulations, immigration laws and employment laws, could decrease foreign direct investment in the U.K., increase costs, depress\\neconomic activity, restrict the Company\\u2019s access to capital and make regulatory compliance and the distribution, sourcing,\\nmanufacturing and sales and marketing of the Company\\u2019s products more difficult or costly. If the U.K. and the European Union are\\nunable to negotiate acceptable withdrawal terms or if other European Union member states pursue withdrawal, barrier-free access\\nbetween the U.K. and other European Union member states or among the European economic area overall could be diminished or\\neliminated. Similar adverse consequences could occur if regions such as Catalonia, where the Company's Spain businesses are\\nheadquartered, eventually succeed in withdrawing from their parent country. Approximately 4% of the Company's net sales are in the\\nU.K. and approximately 16% of the Company's net sales are in the remainder of the European Union. Any of these factors could have a\\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company\\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\\nTerrorist attacks, acts of war or military actions and/or other civil unrest may adversely affect the territories in which the Company\\noperates and the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\\nOn September\\u00a011, 2001, the U.S. was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scope. These attacks contributed to major\\ninstability in the U.S. and other financial markets and reduced consumer confidence. These terrorist attacks, as well as subsequent\\nterrorist attacks (such as those that have occurred in Berlin, Germany; Nice, France; Orlando, Florida; Istanbul, Turkey; Brussels,\\nBelgium; Paris, France; Benghazi, Libya; Madrid, Spain; London, England and most recently the attack on the U.S. embassy in\\nBaghdad, Iraq and the U.S.'s military response to such attack), attempted terrorist attacks, military responses to terrorist attacks, other\\nmilitary actions and/or civil unrest, such as that occurring in France, the Ukraine, Venezuela, Turkey, Syria, Iraq and surrounding areas\\nand, most recently in Hong Kong, may adversely affect prevailing economic conditions, resulting in work stoppages, reduced consumer\\nspending and/or reduced demand for the Company's products. These developments subject the Company's worldwide operations to\\nincreased risks and, depending on their magnitude, could reduce the Company's net sales and therefore could have a material adverse\\neffect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\\n26\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n42/245\"\n",

The Company's Oxford, North Carolina manufacturing facility is\\nregistered with the FDA as a drug manufacturing establishment, permitting the manufacture of cosmetics and other beauty-care\\nproducts that contain over-the-counter drug ingredients, such as sunscreens, anti-perspirant deodorants and anti-dandruff hair-care\\nproducts. Regulations in the U.S., the EU, Canada and other countries in which the Company operates that are designed to protect\\nconsumers or the environment have an increasing influence on the Company's product claims, ingredients and packaging. To the extent\\nfederal, state, local and/or foreign regulatory changes occur in the future, whether due to changes in applicable laws or regulations or\\nevolving interpretations and enforcement policies by regulatory authorities, they could require the Company to reformulate or\\ndiscontinue certain of its products or revise its product packaging or labeling, any of which could result in, among other things,\\nincreased costs to the Company, delays in product launches, product returns or recalls and lower net sales, and therefore could have a\\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\\nAny violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar foreign anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse\\neffect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\\nA significant portion of the Company\\u2019s revenue is derived from operations outside the U.S. and the Company has significant\\nfacilities outside the U.S., which exposes the Company to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in conducting international\\nbusiness transactions. The Company is subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\\\"FCPA\\\") and other similar\\nforeign anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign\\ngovernment officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and other types of improper payments. While the Company\\u2019s\\nemployees and agents are required to comply with these laws and the Company has developed policies and procedures to facilitate\\ncompliance with such laws, there is no assurance that the Company\\u2019s policies and procedures will prevent all violations of these laws,\\ndespite the Company\\u2019s long-standing commitment to conducting its business and achieving its objectives by maintaining the highest\\nlevel of ethical standards and legal compliance. The SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice, and their foreign counterparts, have\\ncontinued to increase their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA and similar foreign anti-corruption laws and any violation of\\nthese laws or allegations of such may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions, as well as other substantial costs and penalties, any\\nof which could have a material adverse effect the Company\\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash\\nflows.\\nDisruptions to the Company's information technology systems could disrupt the Company's business operations which could have a\\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\\nThe operation of the Company's business depends on the Company's information technology systems.

Disruptions to the Company's information technology systems,\\nincluding any disruptions to the Company's current systems and/or as a result of transitioning to additional or replacement information\\ntechnology systems, as the case may be, could disrupt the Company's business and could result in, among other things, transaction\\nerrors, processing inefficiencies, loss of data and the loss of sales and customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the\\nCompany's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

Several governments, including the E.U., have regulations dealing with the collection\\nand use of personal information obtained from their citizens, and regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for\\nprivacy violations.

In addition, the State\\nof California recently enacted a data privacy law applicable to entities serving or employing California residents (the \\u201cCCPA\\u201d) that will\\nrequire compliance by January 2020. The GDPR, the CCPA and other changes in federal, state and foreign laws, rules or regulations\\nassociated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data and other personal information, require the Company to\\nevaluate its current operations, information technology systems and data handling practices and to implement enhancements and\\nadaptations where necessary to comply with these new laws, rules and regulations, which could greatly increase the Company\\u2019s\\noperational costs or require the Company to adapt certain operations or activities to comply with the stricter regulatory requirements.\\nThe Company's inability to comply with such laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and principles or to quickly adapt the Company's\\npractices to reflect them as they develop, could potentially subject the Company to significant fines, damages, liabilities and\\nreputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and/or cash flows.\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n45/245\"\n",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nThe Company previously identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting, which has now been\\nremediated. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on the\\nCompany\\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\\nThe Company previously disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, a material\\nweakness in its internal control over financial reporting primarily related to control deficiencies within various aspects of its control\\nenvironment. As a result of these control deficiencies, the Company concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was not\\neffective for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. During 2019, the Company completed a series of actions and measures that\\neffectively remediated the previously-disclosed material weakness and concluded that as of December 31, 2019 its internal control over\\nfinancial reporting was effective. See Item 9A. \\u2013 \\u201cControls and Procedures\\u201d of this 2019 Form 10-K. The Company cannot provide\\nassurances that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not occur in the future and that it will be able to remediate such\\nweaknesses or deficiencies in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects,\\nresults of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\\nFurthermore, if the remediated material weakness recurs in the future or a new material weakness occurs, it could negatively\\nimpact the Company\\u2019s ability to prepare its future financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. If the Company were unable to\\nprepare its future financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, such circumstances would expose the Company to potential\\nevents of default (if not cured or waived) under the financial and operating covenants contained in Products Corporation\\u2019s various debt\\ninstruments and cause the Company to seek any necessary consents, waivers or amendments from its lenders. Under such\\ncircumstances, Products Corporation faces the risk that it may not be able to obtain any such consents, waivers or amendments, that the\\nterms of any such consents, waivers or amendments will be less favorable than the current terms of its indebtedness and/or Products\\nCorporation may not be able to refinance its existing indebtedness to enable it to repay that indebtedness when it becomes due.

Events and circumstances may occur that are beyond the Company\\u2019s control, such as delays\\ncaused by third parties and unexpected costs, that could result in the Company not realizing all of the anticipated cost reductions and\\nbenefits or the Company not realizing the cost reductions or other benefits on its expected timetable. In addition, changes in foreign\\nexchange rates, commodity costs and/or in tax, labor or other laws may result in the Company not achieving the anticipated cost\\nreductions and benefits, as measured in U.S. dollars. If the Company is unable to realize the Restructuring Programs\\u2019 cost reduction\\nobjectives and other benefits, the Company\\u2019s ability to fund other initiatives and enhance its profitability may be adversely affected. In\\naddition, some of the actions that the Company is taking in furtherance of the Restructuring Programs may become a distraction for the\\nCompany\\u2019s managers and employees and may disrupt the Company\\u2019s ongoing business operations; cause deterioration in employee\\nmorale which may make it more difficult for the Company to retain or attract qualified employees; disrupt or weaken the Company\\u2019s\\ninternal control structures; and/or give rise to negative publicity which could affect the Company\\u2019s business reputation. If the Company\\nis unable to successfully implement the Restructuring Programs, in whole or in part, in accordance with the Company\\u2019s expectations, it\\ncould adversely affect its business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

The Tax Act made broad changes to the U.S. federal income tax code, including reducing the federal\\ncorporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposing limitations on the Company's ability to deduct interest expense for tax purposes\\nand reducing U.S. tax on qualified dividends received from non-U.S. subsidiaries, amongst many other complex provisions. The\\nultimate impact of such tax reforms may differ from the Company's current estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions\\nmade by the Company from the issuance of further regulations or guidance.

(\\\"Revlon\\\" and together with its subsidiaries, the \\\"Company\\\") conducts its business exclusively through its direct\\nwholly-owned operating subsidiary, Revlon Consumer Products Corporation (\\\"Products Corporation\\\"), and its subsidiaries. Revlon is\\nan indirect majority-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated (together with certain of its affiliates other than the\\nCompany, \\\"MacAndrews & Forbes\\\"), a corporation beneficially owned by Ronald O. Perelman.\\nThe Company operates in four brand-centric reporting segments that are aligned with its organizational structure based on four\\nglobal brand teams: Revlon; Elizabeth Arden; Portfolio; and Fragrances. The Company manufactures, markets and sells an extensive\\narray of beauty and personal care products worldwide, including color cosmetics; fragrances; skin care; hair color, hair care and hair\\ntreatments; beauty tools; men's grooming products; anti-perspirant deodorants; and other beauty care products.\\nThe Company remains focused on its 3 key strategic pillars to drive its future success and growth. First, strengthening its iconic\\nbrands through innovation and relevant product portfolios; second, building its capabilities to better communicate and connect with its\\nconsumers through media channels where they spend the most time; and third, ensuring availability of its products where consumers\\nshop, both in-store and increasingly online.\\u00a0\\nFor additional information regarding the Company's business, see \\\"Part 1, Item 1 - Business\\\" in this 2019 Form 10-K.\\nCertain capitalized terms used in this 2019 Form 10-K are defined throughout this Item 7.\\nOverview of Net Sales and Earnings Results\\nConsolidated net sales in 2019 were $2,419.6 million, a $144.9 million decrease, or 5.7%, compared to $2,564.5 million in 2018.\\nExcluding the $55.7 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations (referred herein as \\\"FX\\\", \\\"XFX\\\" or on an \\\"XFX\\nbasis\\\"), consolidated net sales decreased by $89.2 million, or 3.5%, during 2019. The XFX net sales decrease in 2019 was primarily\\ndue to: a $62.8 million, or 11.1%, decrease in Portfolio segment net sales, a $52.1 million, or 10.2%, decrease in Fragrances segment\\nnet sales and a $17.5 million, or 1.8%, decrease in Revlon segment net sales; partially offset by a $43.2 million, or 8.8%, increase in\\nElizabeth Arden segment net sales.\\nConsolidated loss from continuing operations, net of taxes, in 2019 was $165.2 million, compared to consolidated loss from\\ncontinuing operations, net of taxes, of $294.1 million in 2018. The $128.9 million decrease in consolidated loss from continuing\\noperations, net of taxes, in 2019 was primarily due to:\\n\\u2022\\n$143.9 million of lower SG&A expenses, primarily driven by lower brand support expenses as a result of planned lower\\nactivity in 2019 and lower general and administrative expenses, primarily driven by cost reductions related to the Company's\\ncost optimization initiatives and lower incentive compensation;\\n\\u2022\\na $46.7 million increase in gain on divested assets related to the gain of $27.4\\u00a0million recorded in 2019 on the sale of certain\\nassets, compared to a loss on disposal of minority investment of $20.1 million recorded in 2018;\\n\\u2022\\nan $18.0 million decrease in non-cash impairment charges related to the goodwill impairment of the Company's Mass\\nportfolio reporting unit within the Portfolio segment recorded in 2018, compared to no goodwill impairment in 2019;\\n\\u2022\\n$10.0 million of lower acquisition, integration, and divestiture costs;\\n\\u2022\\na $7.4 million decrease in restructuring charges primarily related to lower expenditures under the 2018 Optimization Program\\nin 2019 compared to 2018; and\\n\\u2022\\na $2.0 million decrease in the\\u00a0 provision from\\u00a0 income taxes, primarily due to a decrease in foreign valuation allowances\\nrecorded in 2019, offset by additional tax expense resulting from changes in mix and level of foreign earnings;\\n35\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n53/245\"\n",

The Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program includes rightsizing the organization and\\noperating with more efficient workflows and processes. The leaner organizational structure is also expected to improve communication\\nflow and cross-functional collaboration, leveraging the more efficient business processes.\\nAs a result of the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program, the Company expects to eliminate approximately 1,000 positions\\nworldwide, including approximately 650 current employees and approximately 350 open positions. In March 2020, the Company\\nbegan informing certain employees that will be affected by the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program. While certain aspects of the\\nRevlon 2020 Restructuring Program may be subject to consultations with employees, works councils, unions and/or governmental\\nauthorities, the Company currently expects to substantially complete the employee-related actions by the end of 2020 and the other\\nconsolidation and outsourcing actions during 2021 and 2022.\\nIn connection with implementing the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program, the Company expects to recognize during 2020\\napproximately $55 million to $65 million of total pre-tax restructuring and related charges (the \\u201c2020 Restructuring Charges\\u201d),\\nconsisting primarily of employee-related costs, such as severance, retention and other contractual termination benefits. In addition the\\nCompany expects, restructuring charges in the range of $65 million to $75 million to be charged and paid in the period of 2021 to 2022.\\nThe Company expects that substantially all of these restructuring charges will be paid in cash, with approximately $55 million to $65\\nmillion of the total charges expected to be paid in 2020, approximately $40 million to $45 million expected to be paid in 2021, with the\\nbalance expected to be paid in 2022.\\nAs a result of the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program, the Company expects to deliver in the range of $200 million to $230\\nmillion of annualized cost reductions by the end of 2022, with approximately 60% of these annualized cost reductions to be realized\\nfrom the headcount reductions occurring in 2020.

The approximate $188\\nmillion of net proceeds from the 2019 Term Loan Facility (after taking into account approximately $12 million of related fees and\\nexpenses) were used for general corporate purposes. The 2019 Term Loan Facility will mature on the earliest of: (x) August 6, 2023; (y)\\nthe 180th day prior to the stated maturity of Products Corporation\\u2019s existing 2016 Term Loan Facility, if any loans under the 2016 Term\\nLoan Facility remain outstanding and have not been replaced or refinanced by such date; and (z) the date of any springing maturity of\\nthe 2016 Term Loan Facility (i.e., the 91st day prior to the maturity of the 5.75% Senior Notes due February 15, 2021 if any 5.75%\\nSenior Notes remain outstanding by such date and certain liquidity thresholds are not met). See \\u201cFinancial Condition, Liquidity and\\nCapital Resources - 2019 Term Loan Facility\\u201d for additional details regarding the 2019 Term Loan Facility.\\nGuarantees and Security: Products Corporation and its restricted subsidiaries under the 2019 Term Loan Facility (collectively, the\\n\\u201cRestricted Group\\u201d) are subject to the covenants under the 2019 Term Loan Agreement. The 2019 Term Loan Facility is guaranteed by\\neach existing and future direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiary of Products Corporation (subject to various\\nexceptions), as well as by Revlon, on a limited recourse basis, and Elizabeth Arden (U.K.) Ltd., Revlon Canada Inc. and Elizabeth\\nArden (Canada) Limited. The obligations of Revlon, Products Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors under the 2019 Term Loan\\nFacility are secured by pledges of the equity of Products Corporation and the equity of the Restricted Group held by Products\\nCorporation and each subsidiary guarantor (subject to customary exceptions, including equity of first-tier foreign subsidiaries in excess\\nof 66% of the voting equity interests of such entity) and by substantially all tangible and intangible personal and real property of\\nProducts Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors (subject to customary exclusions). The 2019 Term Loan Facility and the existing\\n2016 Term Loan Facility share the same guarantors and collateral, except that the 2019 Term Loan Facility is also secured by a first-\\npriority lien on certain intellectual property of the American Crew business (the \\u201cAdditional Collateral\\u201d) and is guaranteed by the\\nentities established to hold such Additional Collateral.

Products Corporation entered into a\\nlicense and royalty arrangement on arm\\u2019s length terms with Beautyge II, LLC to provide for the Company\\u2019s continued use of the\\nAdditional Collateral during the term of the 2019 Term Loan Facility.\\nInterest and Fees: Interest accrues on the 2019 Term Loan Facility at a rate per annum of one-month adjusted LIBOR (which has a\\nfloor of 0%) plus a margin of 9.50%.

The 2016 Revolving Credit\\nAgreement provided that the \\u201cLiquidity Amount\\u201d (defined in the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement as the sum of each\\nborrowing base less the sum of (x) the aggregate outstanding extensions of credit under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility,\\nand (y) any availability reserve in effect on such date) may exceed the aggregate commitments under the Amended 2016 Revolving\\nCredit Facility by up to 5%. Amendment No. 2 limits the Liquidity Amount to no more than the aggregate commitments under the\\nAmended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. Under the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement, a \\u201cLiquidity Event Period\\u201d generally occurred\\nif Products Corporation\\u2019s Liquidity Amount fell below the greater of $35\\u00a0million and 10% of the maximum availability under the 2016\\nRevolving Credit Facility. Amendment No. 2 changed these thresholds to $50 million and 15%, respectively, only for purposes of\\ntriggering certain notification obligations of Products Corporation, increased borrowing base reporting frequency and the ability of the\\nadministrative agent to apply amounts collected in controlled accounts for the repayment of loans under the Amended 2016 Revolving\\nCredit Facility. After entering into Amendment No. 2, in March 2019 Products Corporation\\u2019s availability under the Amended 2016\\nRevolving Credit Facility was $37.3\\u00a0million, which was less than the greater of $35\\u00a0million and 10% of the maximum availability\\nunder the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, which at such date equated to $41.3\\u00a0million. Accordingly, effective beginning in\\nMarch 2019 Products Corporation is required to maintain a FCCR of a minimum of 1.0 to 1.0 (which it currently satisfies), the\\nadministrative agent may apply amounts collected in controlled accounts for the repayment of loans under the Amended 2016\\nRevolving Credit Facility, which the administrative agent began applying in March 2019, and Products Corporation is required to\\nprovide the administrative agent with weekly borrowing base certificates. Products Corporation will be required to: (i) maintain such\\n1.0 to 1.0 minimum FCCR until such time that availability under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility equals or exceeds the\\ngreater of $35\\u00a0million and 10% of the maximum availability under such facility for at least 20 consecutive business days; and (ii)\\nProducts Corporation will continue to provide the administrative agent with weekly borrowing base certificates and the administrative\\nagent may continue to apply amounts collected in controlled accounts as set forth above in each case until such time that availability\\nunder such facility is equal or exceeds the greater of $50 million and 15% of the maximum availability under such facility for at least\\n20 consecutive business days. Amendment No. 2 also adjusts, among other things, the \\u201cpayment conditions\\u201d required to make\\nunlimited restricted payments.\\nOperating Segments\\nThe Company operates in four reporting segments: Revlon; Elizabeth Arden; Portfolio; and Fragrances:\\n\\u2022\\nRevlon - The Revlon segment is comprised of the Company's flagship Revlon brands.

The drivers of the increase in gross margin in 2019, as\\ncompared to 2018, primarily included:\\n\\u2022 the impact of additional costs related to the service level disruptions at the Company's Oxford, N.C. manufacturing facility in\\n2018, which did not occur in 2019, resulting in increased gross margin of approximately 0.5 percentage points; and\\n\\u2022 lower inventory obsolescence reserves, which increased gross margin by 0.1 percentage points;\\nwith the foregoing partially offset primarily by:\\n\\u2022 unfavorable FX impacts, which decreased gross margin by 0.4 percentage points; and\\n\\u2022 the impact of tariffs, which decreased gross margin by approximately 0.1 percentage points.\\nSG&A expenses:\\nThe table below shows the Company's SG&A expenses for the periods presented:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2019\\n2018\\nChange\\nSG&A expenses\\n$\\n1,316.6\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\n$\\n1,460.5\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\n$\\n(143.9) \\u00a0\\nSG&A expenses decreased by $143.9 million in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily driven by:\\n\\u2022 lower general and administrative expenses of approximately $66 million, primarily associated with the Company's cost\\noptimization initiatives and lower incentive compensation in 2019 and higher costs in 2018 associated with the departure of\\ncertain executives;\\n\\u2022 a decrease of approximately $50 million in brand support expenses, driven by planned lower activity and cost reduction\\nactivities in 2019, primarily in North America within the Portfolio segment and, to a lesser extent, the Fragrances and the\\nRevlon segments; and\\n\\u2022 favorable FX impact of approximately $26 million.\\nAcquisition, integration and divestiture costs:\\nThe table below shows the Company's acquisition, integration, and divestiture costs for the periods presented:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2019\\n2018\\nChange\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Integration Costs\\n$\\n0.7\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\n$\\n13.9\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\n$\\n(13.2) \\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Divestiture Costs\\n3.2\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\n\\u2014\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\n3.2\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\nTotal acquisition, integration, and divestiture costs\\n$\\n3.9\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\n$\\n13.9\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\n$\\n(10.0) \\u00a0\\nThe Company incurred $3.2 million of divestiture costs in 2019 including $1.9\\u00a0million in professional fees incurred in connection\\nwith the exploration of strategic transactions involving Revlon and third parties and approximately $1.3\\u00a0 million relating to the\\namortization of the cash-based awards under Tier 1 and Tier 2 of the Revlon 2019 Transaction Incentive Program (the \\\"2019 TIP\\\"; see\\nNote 13, \\\"Stock Compensation Plan,\\\" to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2019 Form 10-K for\\nadditional details on the 2019 TIP).\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n70/245\"\n",

During 2019, the Company recorded $33.8 million of restructuring and related charges under the 2018 Optimization Program\\nconsisting of: (i) $16.1 million of severance, personnel benefits and other restructuring costs; and (ii) $17.7 million of other\\nrestructuring-related charges that were recorded within SG&A and cost of sales.

The 2018 Optimization Program\\nresulted in approximately $95 million of in-year cost reductions during 2019, which equate to approximately $125 million of\\nannualized cost reductions.

The $2.0\\nmillion decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2019 compared to 2018, was primarily due to a decrease in foreign valuation\\nallowances recorded in 2019, offset by additional tax expense resulting from changes in mix and level of foreign earnings.

These conclusions\\nregarding the establishment of valuation allowances on the Company's deferred tax assets as of the year ended December 31, 2019 are\\nconsistent with the Company's conclusions on such matters as of the year ended December 31, 2018. However, if the Company does\\nnot generate sufficient taxable income in future periods, its deferred tax assets may not be realizable on a more-likely-than-not basis,\\nwhich would result in the Company having to establish an additional valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.

The\\napproximate $188 million of net proceeds from the 2019 Term Loan Facility (after taking into account approximately $12 million of\\nrelated fees and expenses) were used for general corporate purposes. The 2019 Term Loan Facility will mature on the earliest of: (x)\\nAugust 6, 2023; (y) the 180th day prior to the stated maturity of Products Corporation\\u2019s existing 2016 Term Loan Facility, if any loans\\nunder the 2016 Term Loan Facility remain outstanding and have not been replaced or refinanced by such date; and (z) the date of any\\nspringing maturity of the 2016 Term Loan Facility (i.e., the 91st day prior to the maturity of the 5.75% Senior Notes due February 15,\\n2021 if any 5.75% Senior Notes remain outstanding by such date and certain liquidity thresholds are not met).\\nGuarantees and Security: Products Corporation and its restricted subsidiaries under the 2019 Term Loan Facility (collectively, the\\n\\u201cRestricted Group\\u201d) are subject to the covenants under the 2019 Term Loan Agreement. The 2019 Term Loan Facility is guaranteed by\\neach existing and future direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiary of Products Corporation (subject to various\\nexceptions), as well as by Revlon, on a limited recourse basis, and Elizabeth Arden (U.K.) Ltd., Revlon Canada Inc. and Elizabeth\\nArden (Canada) Limited. The obligations of Revlon, Products Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors under the 2019 Term Loan\\nFacility are secured by pledges of the equity of Products Corporation and the equity of the Restricted Group held by Products\\nCorporation and each subsidiary guarantor (subject to customary exceptions, including equity of first-tier foreign subsidiaries in excess\\nof 66% of the voting equity interests of such entity) and by substantially all tangible and intangible personal and real property of\\nProducts Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors (subject to customary exclusions).

      "  \"content\": \"In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act, which made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code,\\nincluding a one-time transition tax on certain non-U.S. earnings, the current U.S. taxation of certain foreign earnings in 2018 and\\nfollowing years and limitations on tax deductions for interest expense in 2018 and following years. The Company was not subject to\\nthe one-time transition tax due to its deficit in foreign earnings as of the applicable measurement dates. Additionally, the Company\\ndetermined that the limitation on interest deductibility did not impact the Company's 2018 federal cash taxes due to its net operating\\nloss position. Further, as a result of the Company\\u2019s anticipated net operating loss carryover to 2019, the Company expects that the Tax\\nAct will not have a material impact on the Company's cash taxes or liquidity in 2019.

The physical condition and marketability of the returned products are the major factors the Company\\nconsiders in estimating realizable value. Cost of sales includes the cost of refurbishment of returned products. Actual returns, as well as\\nrealized values on returned products, may differ significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the Company\\u2019s estimates if factors\\nsuch as product discontinuances, customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from the Company\\u2019s estimates and\\nexpectations and, in the case of actual product returns, if economic conditions differ significantly from the Company\\u2019s estimates and\\nexpectations. For returned products that the Company expects to resell at a profit, the Company records, in addition to sales returns as a\\nreduction to sales and cost of sales and an increase to accrued liabilities for the amount expected to be refunded to the customer, an\\nincrease to the asset account used to reflect the Company's right to recover products. The amount of the asset account is valued based\\nupon the former carrying amount of the product (i.e., inventory), less any expected costs to recover the products. As the estimated\\nproduct returns that are expected to be resold at a profit do not comprise a significant amount of the Company's net sales or assets, the\\nCompany does not separately report these amounts.\\nPension Benefits:\\nThe Company sponsors both funded and unfunded pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering employees who\\nmeet the applicable eligibility requirements. The Company uses several statistical and other factors in an attempt to estimate future\\nevents in calculating the liability and net periodic benefit income/cost related to these plans. These factors include assumptions about\\nthe discount rate, expected long-term return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined annually by the\\nCompany, within certain guidelines, which assumptions would be subject to revisions if significant events occur during the year. The\\nCompany uses December 31st as its measurement date for defined benefit pension plan obligations and plan assets.\\nThe Company applies the \\\"full yield curve\\\" approach, an alternative approach from the single weighted-average discount rate\\napproach, to calculate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other post-retirement benefits.\\nUnder this method, the discount rate assumption was built through the application of specific spot rates along the yield curve used in\\nthe determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows for each of the Company's pension and other retirement\\nplans.\\nThe Company utilized a 3.01% weighted-average discount rate in 2019 for the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans,\\ncompared to a 4.13% weighted-average discount rate in 2018. The Company utilized a 1.81% weighted-average discount rate for the\\nCompany\\u2019s international defined benefit pension plans in 2019, compared to a 2.52% weighted-average discount rate selected in 2018.\\nThe discount rates are used to measure the benefit obligations at the measurement date and the net periodic benefit income/cost for the\\nsubsequent calendar year and are reset annually using data available at the measurement date. The changes in the discount rates used\\nfor 2019 were primarily due to observed decreases in long-term interest yields on high-quality corporate bonds during 2019. At\\nDecember 31, 2019, the decrease in the discount rates from December 31,\\u00a02018\\u00a0had the effect of increasing the Company\\u2019s projected\\npension benefit obligation by approximately\\u00a0$65.5\\u00a0million.\\n60\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n85/245\"\n",

While the Company considered both the recent\\nperformance and the historical performance of plan assets, the Company\\u2019s assumptions are based primarily on its estimates of long-\\nterm, prospective rates of return. The difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of\\naccumulated other comprehensive (loss) income and the resulting gains or losses are amortized over future periods as a component of\\nthe net periodic benefit cost. For the Company\\u2019s U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the expected long-term rate of return on the\\npension plan assets used was 6.00% for both 2019 and 2018. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return used for the\\nCompany\\u2019s international plans was 4.86% for 2019 and 4.95% for 2018. For 2019, the actual return on pension plan assets was $61.3\\nmillion, as compared with expected return on plan assets of $25.1 million. The resulting net deferred gain of $36.2 million, when\\ncombined with gains and losses from previous years, will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 10 to 30 years. The\\nactual return on plan assets for 2019 was above expectations, primarily due to higher returns from investments in developed equity\\nmarkets, bank loans and bond yields.\\nThe table below reflects the Company\\u2019s estimates of the possible effects that changes in the discount rates and expected long-term\\nrates of return would have had on its 2019 net periodic benefit costs and its projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2019 for the\\nCompany\\u2019s principal defined benefit pension plans, with all other assumptions remaining constant:\\nEffect of\\nEffect of\\n25 basis points increase\\n25 basis points decrease\\nNet periodic\\nbenefit costs\\nProjected\\npension benefit\\nobligation\\nNet periodic\\nbenefit costs\\nProjected pension\\nbenefit obligation\\nDiscount rate\\n$\\n1.7\\u00a0 \\u00a0 $\\n(15.6) \\u00a0 $\\n1.5\\u00a0 \\u00a0 $\\n16.3\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\nExpected long-term rate of return\\n$\\n(0.4) \\u00a0 $\\n\\u2014\\u00a0 \\u00a0 $\\n1.8\\u00a0 \\u00a0 $\\n\\u2014\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\nThe rate of future compensation increases is another assumption used by the Company\\u2019s third-party actuarial consultants for\\npension accounting. The rate of future compensation increases used for the Company\\u2019s projected pension benefit obligation in both\\n2019 and 2018 was 3.50% for the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Such increase was not applied to the Revlon Employees\\u2019\\nRetirement Plan and the Revlon Pension Equalization Plan, as the rate of future compensation increases is no longer relevant to such\\nplans due to plan amendments that effectively froze these plans as of December 31, 2009. During 2019, the UAW Plan was frozen and\\nthe rate of future compensation increase is no longer applicable.\\nIn addition, the Company's actuarial consultants also use other factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The actuarial\\nassumptions used by the Company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or\\nlower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants, among other things. Differences from these assumptions could\\nsignificantly impact the actual amount of net periodic benefit cost and liability recorded by the Company.\\nTo determine the fiscal 2020 net periodic benefit income/cost, the Company is using the \\\"full yield curve\\\" approach described\\nabove to separately calculate discount rates for each of the service and interest components. The following table represents the\\nweighted average discount rates used in calculating each component of service and interest costs for the Company's U.S. and\\ninternational defined benefit pension plans:\\nU.S.\\nPlans\\nInternational\\nPlans\\nInterest cost on projected benefit obligation\\n2.58\\u00a0%\\n1.95\\u00a0 %\\nService cost(a)\\nN/A\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\n0.32\\u00a0 %\\nInterest cost on service cost(a)\\nN/A\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\n0.16\\u00a0 %\\n(a) Service cost and interest on service cost are no longer applicable for the U.S. plans as the UAW Plan was frozen during 2019.\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n86/245\"\n",

The fair values of the acquired\\nintangible assets are primarily calculated using a discounted cash flow approach.\\nDetermining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on evaluating a number of factors, such as\\nmarketplace participants, product life cycles, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations. There are\\nsignificant judgments inherent in a discounted cash flow approach, including in selecting appropriate discount rates, hypothetical\\nroyalty rates, contributory asset capital charges, estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and identifying appropriate\\nterminal growth rate assumptions. The discount rates used in discounted cash flow analyses are intended to reflect the risk inherent in\\nthe projected future cash flows generated by the respective acquired intangible assets.\\nDetermining an acquired intangible asset's useful life requires management judgment and is based on evaluating a number of\\nfactors, including the expected use of the asset, consumer awareness, trade name history and future expansion expectations, as well as\\nany contractual provisions that could limit or extend an asset's useful life. The Company believes that an acquired trade name has an\\nindefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and the Company has the intent and ability to support the\\ntrade name with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If this indefinite-lived criteria is not met, acquired trade names are\\namortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 5 to 20 years.\\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company implemented its brand-centric organizational structure which is built around four global\\nbrand teams: Revlon; Elizabeth Arden; Portfolio; and Fragrances, which also represent the Company's reporting segments. Concurrent\\nwith the change in reporting segments, goodwill was reassigned to the affected reporting units that have been identified within each\\nreporting segment using a relative fair value allocation approach as outlined in Accounting Standards Codification (\\\"ASC\\\")\\n350,\\u00a0 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. Goodwill totaled $673.7 million and $673.9 million as of December\\u00a0 31, 2019 and 2018,\\nrespectively. As of December\\u00a031, 2019, goodwill of $264.9 million, $171.1 million, $116.9 million and $120.8 million related to the\\nRevlon, Portfolio, Elizabeth Arden and Fragrances segments, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangibles totaled $143.8 million and\\n$145.2 million as of December\\u00a031, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\nIn accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\\\"FASB\\\"), Accounting Standard Codification (\\\"ASC\\\") 350, Intangibles\\n- Goodwill and Other (\\\"ASC 350\\\"), goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but rather are reviewed annually\\nfor impairment using October 1st carrying values, or when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\\ncurrent carrying amounts may not be recovered. Under this standard, the Company annually has the option to first assess qualitatively,\\nbased on relevant events and circumstances, whether it is more likely than not that there has been an impairment, or perform a\\nquantitative analysis to assess the existence of any such impairment.\\u00a0If the qualitative analysis shows that it is more likely than not that\\nthe fair value of a reporting unit is higher than its carrying amount, the quantitative analysis is not required. If the qualitative analysis\\nfails, the quantitative analysis is required. Per the simplified approach allowed under ASU No. 2017-04, \\\"Simplifying the Test for\\nGoodwill Impairment,\\\" adopted by the Company as of October 1, 2018, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value\\nof the reporting unit, the goodwill impairment charge is equal to the amount of such difference. The inputs and assumptions utilized in\\nthe analyses are classified as Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.\\nThe Company establishes its reporting units based on its current reporting structure, product characteristics and management.\\nWithin each of the Elizabeth Arden and Portfolio segments, the Company has identified two reporting units. The two reporting units\\nwithin the Elizabeth Arden segment are: (i) Elizabeth Arden Skin and Color, which includes Elizabeth Arden skin care and color\\ncosmetics brands; and (ii) Elizabeth Arden Fragrances, which includes Elizabeth Arden branded fragrances. The two reporting units\\nwithin the Portfolio segment are: (i) Mass Portfolio, which includes the Company's brands sold primarily through the mass retail\\nchannel; and (ii) Professional Portfolio, which includes the Company's brands sold primarily through professional salons. The\\nCompany's Revlon and Fragrances reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 17, \\\"Segment Data and\\nRelated Information,\\\" in the Company\\u2019s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2019 Form 10-K. For purposes of testing\\ngoodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to each reporting unit to the extent that goodwill relates to each reporting unit.\\n62\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n88/245\"\n",

The Company utilized the two-step process\\nin assessing whether goodwill was impaired for each of the Company's six reporting units: (i) Revlon; (ii) Elizabeth Arden Skin and\\nColor; (iii) Elizabeth Arden Fragrances; (iv) Mass Portfolio; (v) Professional Portfolio; and (vi) Fragrances. As a result of this\\nimpairment testing, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of each of these reporting units\\nexceeded their respective carrying amounts.\\nAnnual impairment testing\\nFor 2019, in assessing whether goodwill was impaired in connection with its annual impairment testing performed during the\\nfourth quarter of 2019 using October 1st, 2019 carrying values, the Company, in accordance with ASC 350, performed qualitative\\nassessments for its (i) Revlon, (ii) Elizabeth Arden Skin and Color and (iii) Fragrances reporting units and a quantitative assessment for\\nits (x) Mass Portfolio, (y) Professional Portfolio and (z) Elizabeth Arden Fragrances reporting units.\\nIn performing the 2019 qualitative assessment, the Company considered, among other factors, the financial performance of each of\\nits Revlon, Elizabeth Arden Skin and Color and Fragrances reporting units, as well as the results of the annual quantitative analysis\\nperformed in 2018 for each of these reporting units. Based upon such assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than\\nnot that the fair value of each of its Revlon, Elizabeth Arden Skin and Color and Fragrances reporting units exceeded their respective\\ncarrying amounts for 2019.\\nIn performing the 2019 quantitative assessment, the Company used the simplified approach allowed under ASU No. 2017-04,\\n\\\"Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,\\\" which the Company early adopted in October 2018, to test its Mass Portfolio,\\nProfessional Portfolio and Elizabeth Arden Fragrances reporting units for impairment. Based upon such assessment, the Company\\ndetermined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of each of its Mass Portfolio, Professional Portfolio and Elizabeth Arden\\nFragrances reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts for 2019. The fair values of the Company\\u2019s reporting units\\nexceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 8% to approximately 58% as of the October 1, 2019 valuation date. The\\nfair values of the Mass Portfolio, Professional Portfolio and Elizabeth Arden Fragrances reporting units are in excess of the respective\\ncarrying values by approximately 8%, 12%, and 12%, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the Mass Portfolio, Professional\\nPortfolio and Elizabeth Arden Fragrances reporting units had goodwill balances of $54.3 million, $116.8 million and $49.4 million,\\nrespectively.\\nThe above-mentioned fair values were determined using a weighted average market and income approach. The income approach\\nrequires several assumptions including future sales growth, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization)\\nmargins, and capital expenditures, which are the basis for the information used in the discounted cash flow model. The key assumptions\\nused to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting unit are predicated on the success of future new product launches, the\\nachievement of international expansion plans, and the realization of cost reduction and other efficiency efforts. If such plans do not\\nmaterialize, or if there are further challenges in the business environment in which this reporting unit operates, a resulting change in the\\nkey assumptions (e.g., long-term financial projections) could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit,\\nand it is possible the Company could recognize an impairment charge.\\nFor 2018, the Company first performed a qualitative assessment on all of its reporting units, which indicated that indicators of\\nimpairment existed for its Mass Portfolio reporting unit within the Portfolio segment. Subsequently, the Company used the simplified\\napproach allowed under ASU No. 2017-04 to test its Mass Portfolio reporting unit for impairment. Following the results of such\\nassessment, the Company recognized an $18.0 million\\u00a0non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the Mass Portfolio reporting\\nunit within the Portfolio segment in the fourth quarter of 2018. Following the recognition of this non-cash goodwill impairment charge,\\nthe Mass Portfolio reporting unit had\\u00a0$54.3\\u00a0million\\u00a0in remaining goodwill as of December 31, 2018.\\nFor each of 2019 and 2018, no impairment was recognized related to the carrying value of any of the Company's finite or\\nindefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of the annual impairment testing.\\nSee Note 7, \\\"Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,\\\" to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2019\\nForm 10-K for further information on the Company's goodwill and intangible assets.\\n63\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n89/245\"\n",

The Company's management, with the participation of\\nthe Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure\\ncontrols and procedures as of the end of the fiscal period covered by this 2019 Form 10-K. Based upon such evaluation, the Company's\\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were\\neffective as of December 31, 2019. Please see section (b) below for a discussion of the Company\\u2019s remediation of a previously-reported\\nmaterial weakness.\\n(b) Management\\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. The Company\\u2019s management is responsible\\nfor establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company\\u2019s internal control system is designed\\nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of published\\nfinancial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of\\nrecords that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of its assets; (ii) provide reasonable\\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of its financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP,\\nand that its receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and (iii)\\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's\\nassets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.\\nDue to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management's\\nprojections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as to future periods are subject to the risks\\nthat controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\\nmay deteriorate. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such\\nthat there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be\\nprevented or detected on a timely basis.\\nThe Company\\u2019s management, under the oversight of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the\\neffectiveness of the Company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 and in making this assessment used\\nthe criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission Internal Control-Integrated\\nFramework (2013). Based on this assessment, the Company\\u2019s management, under the oversight of the Chief Executive Officer and\\nChief Financial Officer, determined that the Company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,\\n2019.

Also, projections\\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ KPMG LLP\\nNew York, New York\\nMarch\\u00a012, 2020\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n116/245\"\n",

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\nRevlon, Inc. (\\\"Revlon\\\" and together with its subsidiaries, the \\\"Company\\\") conducts its business exclusively through its direct\\nwholly-owned operating subsidiary, Revlon Consumer Products Corporation (\\\"Products Corporation\\\") and its subsidiaries. Revlon is an\\nindirect majority-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated (together with certain of its affiliates other than the\\nCompany, \\\"MacAndrews & Forbes\\\"), a corporation beneficially owned by Ronald O. Perelman. Mr. Perelman is Chairman of Revlon's\\nand Product Corporation's Board of Directors.\\nThe Company is a leading global beauty company with an iconic portfolio of brands that develops, manufactures, markets,\\ndistributes and sells an extensive array of color cosmetics; hair color, hair care and hair treatments; fragrances; skin care; beauty tools;\\nmen\\u2019s grooming products; anti-perspirant deodorants; and other beauty care products across a variety of distribution channels.\\nThe Company operates in four brand-centric reporting units that are aligned with its organizational structure based on four global\\nbrand teams: Revlon; Elizabeth Arden; Portfolio; and Fragrances, which represent the Company's four reporting segments. Revlon\\nsegment products are primarily marketed, distributed and sold in the mass retail channel, large volume retailers, chain drug and food\\nstores, chemist shops, hypermarkets, general merchandise stores, e-commerce sites, television shopping, department stores,\\nprofessional hair and nail salons, one-stop shopping beauty retailers and specialty cosmetic stores in the U.S. and internationally. The\\nCompany's principal customers for its products in the Elizabeth Arden segment include prestige retailers, the mass retail channel,\\nperfumeries, boutiques, department and specialty stores, e-commerce sites and travel retailers and distributors, as well as direct sales to\\nconsumers via Elizabeth Arden branded retail stores and e-commerce websites. During 2019, the Company re-acquired from its third-\\nparty licensee the rights to use the Elizabeth Arden and Red Door trademarks in connection with operating beauty salons and spas. In\\n2018, the Company launched direct-to-consumer on-line selling capabilities through its elizabetharden.com, americancrew.com,\\njuicycouturebeauty.com and fleshbeauty.com websites. The Company\\u2019s Portfolio segment markets, distributes and sells a\\ncomprehensive line of premium, specialty and mass products primarily to the mass retail channel, hair and nail salons and professional\\nsalon distributors in the U.S. and internationally and large volume retailers, specialty and department stores. The Fragrance segment\\nproducts are typically sold to retailers in the U.S. and internationally, including prestige retailers, specialty stores, e-commerce sites, the\\nmass retail channel, travel retailers and other international retailers. For further information, refer to Note 17, \\\"Segment Data and\\nRelated Information.\\\"\\nUnless the context otherwise requires, all references to the Company mean Revlon and its subsidiaries, including, without\\nlimitation, its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Products Corporation. Revlon as a public holding company, has no business\\noperations of its own and owns, as its only material asset, all of the outstanding capital stock of Products Corporation. As such, its net\\nincome/(loss) has historically consisted predominantly of the net income/(loss) of Products Corporation, and in 2019 and 2018 included\\n$7.9\\u00a0million and $6.3\\u00a0million, respectively, in expenses incidental to being a public holding company.\\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company's accounts after the elimination of all material\\nintercompany balances and transactions. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\\nThe preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting\\nprinciples (\\\"U.S. GAAP\\\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts of assets and liabilities and\\ndisclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses\\nduring the periods presented. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and\\nthe effects of revisions are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the period they are determined to be necessary.\\nSignificant estimates made in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include, but are not limited to: expected sales\\nreturns; certain assumptions related to the valuation of acquired intangible and long-lived assets and the recoverability of goodwill,\\nintangible and long-lived assets; income taxes, including deferred tax valuation allowances and reserves for estimated tax liabilities;\\nand certain estimates and assumptions used in the calculation of the net periodic benefit (income) costs and the projected benefit\\nobligations for the Company\\u2019s pension and other post-retirement plans, including the expected long-term return on pension plan assets\\nand the discount rate used to value the Company\\u2019s pension benefit obligations.\\nF-13\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n137/245\"\n",

      "  \"content\": \"Table of Contents\\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n(except where otherwise noted, all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\\nDiscontinued Operations Presentation\\nAs a result of the Company's decision on December 30, 2013 to exit its direct manufacturing, warehousing and sales business\\noperations in mainland China within the Revlon segment effective December 31, 2013, the Company reports the results of its former\\nChina operations within income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the Company's Consolidated Statements of\\nOperations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. See Note 3, \\\"Discontinued Operations,\\\" for further discussion.\\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less.\\nAccounts payable include $13.3 million and $23.4\\u00a0million of outstanding checks not yet presented for payment at December 31, 2019\\nand 2018, respectively. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the\\nstatements of financial position that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the statements of cash flows:\\nDecember 31,\\n2019\\n2018\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n104.3\\u00a0 \\u00a0 $\\n87.3\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\nRestricted cash(a)\\n0.2\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\n0.2\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\\n$\\n104.5\\u00a0 \\u00a0 $\\n87.5\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\n(a)Amounts included in restricted cash represent cash on deposit to support the Company's letters of credit and is included within other assets in the Company's\\nconsolidated balance sheets.\\nTrade Receivables\\nTrade receivables represent payments due to the Company for previously recognized net sales, reduced by an allowance for\\ndoubtful accounts for balances which are estimated to be uncollectible at period end. The Company grants credit terms in the normal\\ncourse of business to its customers. Trade credit is extended based upon periodically updated evaluations of each customer's ability to\\nperform its payment obligations. The Company does not normally require collateral or other security to support credit sales. The\\nCompany's three largest customers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 33% and 30% of the Company's outstanding trade\\nreceivables at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\nInventories\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is based on standard cost and production variances, which\\napproximates actual cost on the first-in, first-out method. Cost components include direct materials, direct labor and direct overhead, as\\nwell as in-bound freight. The Company records adjustments to the value of its inventory based upon its forecasted plans to sell products\\nincluded in inventory, as well as planned product discontinuances. The physical condition (e.g., age and quality) of the inventories is\\nalso considered in establishing its valuation. These adjustments are estimates, which could vary significantly, either favorably or\\nunfavorably, from the amounts that the Company may ultimately realize upon the disposition of inventories if future economic\\nconditions, customer inventory levels, product discontinuances, sales return levels or competitive conditions differ from the Company's\\nestimates and expectations.\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Other Assets\\nProperty, plant and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of such\\nassets as follows: land improvements, 20 to 30 years; buildings and improvements, 5 to 50 years; machinery and equipment, 3 to 15\\nyears; counters and trade fixtures, 3 to 5 years; office furniture and fixtures, 3 to 15 years; and capitalized software, 2 to 10 years.\\nLeasehold improvements and building improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives or over the terms of the leases or\\nremaining life of the original structure, whichever is shorter. Repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of operations as\\nincurred, and expenditures for additions and improvements are capitalized. Counters and trade fixtures are amortized over their\\nestimated useful life of the in-store counter and display related assets. The estimated useful life may be subject to change based upon\\ndeclines in net sales and/or changes in merchandising programs.

In the event of product discontinuances, from time-to-\\ntime, the Company may accelerate the amortization of related permanent wall displays based on the estimated remaining useful life of\\nthe asset. Amortization expense for permanent wall displays was $55.6\\u00a0million and $50.7\\u00a0million for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If events or changes in\\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company estimates the undiscounted future\\ncash flows (excluding interest) resulting from the use of the asset and its ultimate disposition. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows\\n(excluding interest) is less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes an impairment loss, measured as the amount by which the\\ncarrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. There were no impairment charges to long-lived assets during the years ended\\nDecember 31, 2019 and 2018.\\nDeferred Financing Costs\\nThe Company capitalizes deferred financing costs related to the issuance of revolving lines of credit and amortizes such costs over\\nthe terms of the related debt instruments using the effective-interest method. Capitalized deferred financing costs were nil and\\n$4.0\\u00a0million during 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\nLeases\\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (\\\"ASU\\\") No. 2016-02, \\\"Leases (Topic 842)\\\" (\\\"ASU No. 2016-02\\\" or \\\"ASC\\n842\\\"), beginning as of January 1, 2019, using a modified retrospective approach and applying the standard\\u2019s transition provisions at the\\neffective date of January 1, 2019. ASU No. 2016-02 requires that a lessee recognize, for both finance leases and operating leases, a\\nliability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a Right-of-Use (\\u201cROU\\u201d) asset representing its right to use the underlying\\nleased asset for the lease term. The lease liability is equal to the present value of the lease payments and the ROU asset is based on the\\nlease liability, subject to certain adjustments, such as pre-payments, initial direct costs, lease incentives and accrued rent. In addition,\\nupon adoption the Company elected the available practical expedients allowed by the guidance under:\\n\\u2022\\nASC 842-10-15-37, by not separating lease components from non-lease components and instead accounting for all\\ncomponents as a single lease component for all of its classes of underlying assets, i.e., for any type of equipment leases and\\nreal estate leases; and\\n\\u2022\\nASC 842-10-65-1, by not reassessing at the transition date: (i) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases;\\n(ii) lease classification for any expired or existing leases; and (iii) initial direct costs for any existing leases.\\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception, considering whether the contract conveys a right to control the\\nuse of the identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Operating leases are included in ROU assets, recorded\\nwithin \\u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment,\\u201d and operating lease liabilities are recorded within either \\\"Accrued expenses and other current\\nliabilities\\\" and/or \\\"Other long-term liabilities\\\" in the Company\\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in ROU\\nassets recorded within \\u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment,\\u201d and finance lease liabilities are recorded within either \\\"Accrued expenses and\\nother current liabilities\\\" and/or \\\"Other long-term liabilities\\\" in the Company\\u2019s consolidated balance sheets, given their immateriality.\\nAs most of the Company\\u2019s leases do not provide the lease implicit rates, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rates as the\\ndiscount rate, adjusted as applicable, based on the information available at the lease commencement dates to determine the present\\nvalue of lease payments. The Company may use the lease implicit rate, when readily determinable, as the discount rate to determine the\\npresent value of lease payments.\\nLease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that\\noption. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term.\\nAt lease commencement, for initial measurement, variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate, if any, are\\nexcluded from lease payments. Subsequent to initial measurement, these variable payments are recognized when the event determining\\nthe amount of the variable consideration to be paid occurs. Leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less are not included in the\\nlease liability or ROU asset.\\nF-15\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n139/245\"\n",

See Note 7, \\\"Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,\\\" for\\nfurther discussion of the Company's intangible assets, including a summary of finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets.\\nRevenue Recognition and Sales Returns\\nOn January 1, 2018 the Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09, \\\"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\\\" using the modified\\nretrospective method. Results for the reporting period beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under this new guidance, while\\nprior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with the Company's historical accounting practices under previous\\nguidance. However, given the nature of the Company's products and the terms and conditions applicable to sales to its customers, the\\ntiming and amount of revenue recognized based on the underlying principles of this guidance are consistent with the Company's\\nrevenue recognition policy under previous guidance.\\nIn accordance with the new guidance, the Company's policy is to recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration\\nthat the Company expects that it will be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to its customers. The\\nCompany's policy is to record revenue when control of the goods transfers to the customer. Net sales are comprised of gross revenues\\nfrom sales of products less expected product returns, trade discounts and customer allowances, which include costs associated with off-\\ninvoice mark-downs and other price reductions, as well as trade promotions and coupons.\\nThe Company allows customers to return their unsold products if and when they meet certain Company-established criteria as set\\nforth in the Company's trade terms. The Company regularly reviews and revises, when deemed necessary, its estimates of sales returns\\nbased primarily upon the historical rate of actual product returns, planned product discontinuances, new product launches and estimates\\nof customer inventory and promotional sales. For returned products that the Company expects to resell at a profit, the Company\\nrecords, in addition to sales returns as a reduction to sales and cost of sales and an increase to accrued liabilities for the amount\\nexpected to be refunded to the customer, an increase to the asset account used to reflect the Company's right to recover products. The\\namount of the asset account is valued based upon the former carrying amount of the product (i.e., inventory), less any expected costs to\\nrecover the products. As the estimated product returns that are expected to be resold at a profit do not comprise a significant amount of\\nthe Company's net sales or assets, the Company does not separately report these amounts.\\nThe Company's revenues are also net of certain marketing arrangements with its retail customers. Pursuant to its trade terms with\\nthese retail customers, the Company reimburses them for a portion of their advertising costs, which provide advertising benefits to the\\nCompany. These arrangements are in the form of marketing development funds and/or cooperative advertising programs and are used\\nby the Company to drive sales. The advertising programs follow an annual schedule of planned events that is continually updated based\\non the Company's perceived needs and contractual terms. As these marketing expenditures cannot be directly linked to product sales,\\nthe Company records these expenses as a reduction of revenue at the higher of actual spend or estimated costs based on a reserve rate\\nmethodology. In limited instances when products are sold under consignment arrangements, the Company does not recognize revenue\\nuntil control over such products has transferred to the end consumer. Other revenues, primarily royalties, do not comprise a material\\namount of the Company's net sales.\\nThe Company incurs costs associated with product distribution, such as freight and handling costs. The Company has elected to\\ntreat these costs as fulfillment activities and recognizes these costs at the same time that it recognizes the underlying product revenue.\\nF-17\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n142/245\"\n",

For products manufactured in the Company's own\\nfacilities, such costs include raw materials and supplies, direct labor and factory overhead. For products manufactured for the Company\\nby third-party contractors, such cost represents the amounts invoiced by the contractors. Cost of sales also includes the cost of\\nrefurbishing products returned by customers that will be offered for resale and the cost of inventory write-downs associated with\\nadjustments of held inventories to their net realizable value. These costs are reflected in the Company\\u2019s consolidated statements of\\noperations and comprehensive (loss) income when the product is sold and net sales revenues are recognized or, in the case of inventory\\nwrite-downs, when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of inventories is in excess of their recoverable value. Additionally,\\ncost of sales reflects the costs associated with certain free products included as sales and promotional incentives. These incentive costs\\nare recognized at the same time that the Company recognizes the related revenue.\\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\\nSelling, general and administrative (\\\"SG&A\\\") expenses include expenses to advertise the Company's products, such as television\\nadvertising production costs and air-time costs, print advertising costs, digital marketing costs, promotional displays and consumer\\npromotions. SG&A expenses also include the amortization of permanent wall displays and finite-lived intangible assets, depreciation of\\ncertain fixed assets, distribution costs (such as freight and handling), non-manufacturing overhead (principally personnel and related\\nexpenses), selling and trade educations fees, insurance and professional service fees.\\nAdvertising\\nAdvertising within SG&A expenses includes television, print, digital marketing and other advertising production costs that are\\nexpensed the first time the advertising takes place. The costs of promotional displays are expensed in the period in which they are\\nshipped to customers. Advertising expenses were $446.8\\u00a0 million and\\u00a0 $507.0\\u00a0 million\\u00a0 for\\u00a0 2019 and\\u00a0 2018, respectively, which were\\nincluded in SG&A expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. The Company\\nalso has various arrangements with customers pursuant to its trade terms to reimburse them for a portion of their advertising costs,\\nwhich provide advertising benefits to the Company. Additionally, from time-to-time, the Company may pay fees to customers in order\\nto expand or maintain shelf space for its products. The costs that the Company incurs for \\\"cooperative\\\" advertising programs, end cap\\nplacement, shelf placement costs, slotting fees and marketing development funds, if any, are expensed as incurred and are recorded as a\\nreduction within net sales.\\nDistribution Costs\\nCosts associated with product distribution, such as freight and handling costs, are recorded within SG&A expenses when incurred.\\nDistribution costs were\\u00a0$135.7\\u00a0million and $144.6\\u00a0million for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\nIncome Taxes\\nIncome taxes are calculated using the asset and liability method. Under this method, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets\\nand liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of\\nassets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures\\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary\\ndifferences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company recognizes the effect of a change in income tax rates on deferred tax\\nassets and liabilities in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records valuation allowances to reduce\\ndeferred tax assets when management determines that it was more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The Company\\nrecognizes a tax position in its financial statements when management determines that it was more likely than not that the position will\\nbe sustained upon examination, based on the merits of such position. The Company recognizes liabilities for unrecognized tax positions\\nin the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due. If payment\\nof these amounts is ultimately not required, the reversal of the liabilities would result in additional tax benefits recognized in the period\\nin which the Company determines that the liabilities are no longer required. If the estimate of tax liabilities is ultimately less than the\\nfinal assessment, this will result in a further charge to expense. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax\\nmatters in income tax expense.

See Note\\n11, \\\"Financial Instruments,\\\" for further information on the Company's 2013 Interest Rate Swap. Refer to Note 9, \\\"Debt,\\\" for further\\ndetails related to financing the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition and related debt restructuring transactions.\\nRecent Transactions\\nIn connection with the Company's ongoing Strategic Review, during 2019 the divestiture from certain brands resulted in gains on\\nsale of assets of approximately $27.4\\u00a0million, which are recorded in \\\"(Gain) loss on divested assets\\\" on the Company's Consolidated\\nStatement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as of December 31, 2019.\\nSee Note 22, \\u201cSubsequent Events\\u201d for more recent transactions.\\nRecently Evaluated and/ or Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, which requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a related lease\\nliability on the balance sheet for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases. The lease liability will be equal to the present value\\nof lease payments and the right-of-use asset will be based on the lease liability, subject to certain adjustments, such as initial direct\\ncosts. Leases will continue to be classified as either operating or finance leases in the income statement. This guidance is effective for\\nannual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02 beginning\\nas of January 1, 2019, using a modified retrospective approach and applying the standard\\u2019s transition provisions at the effective date of\\nJanuary 1, 2019. In addition, the Company elected to apply the package of practical expedients identified under ASC 842. As of\\nJanuary 1, 2019, the Company used an average discount rate of approximately 16%, based on an estimate of the Company's\\nincremental borrowing rates. See Note 6, \\\"Property, Plant and Equipment,\\\" for additional disclosures provided as a result of ASU 2016-\\n02.\\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, \\\"Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) -\\nReclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income,\\\" which gives entities the option to reclassify\\ntax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \\\"Tax Act\\\") to\\nretained earnings. The guidance was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December\\n15, 2018. Entities are required to make additional disclosures, regardless of whether they elect to reclassify stranded amounts of tax\\neffects. The Company has elected not to adopt this amendment and will include required financial statement disclosures, as applicable.\\nNo impact is expected to the Company\\u2019s results of operations and/or financial condition.\\nF-20\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n146/245\"\n",

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\\nIn December 2013, the Company announced restructuring actions that primarily included exiting its direct manufacturing,\\nwarehousing and sales business operations in mainland China within the Revlon segment (the \\\"December 2013 Program\\\"). The\\nDecember 2013 Program resulted in the elimination of approximately 1,100 positions in 2014, primarily in China. With the\\nimplementation of the December 2013 Program, the results of the China discontinued operations, which relate entirely to the Revlon\\nsegment, are included within income from discontinued operations, net of taxes. Notwithstanding this 2013 program, the Company re-\\nlaunched the Revlon brand in China in July 2019. The summary comparative financial results of discontinued operations were as\\nfollows for the periods presented:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2019\\n2018\\nNet sales\\n$\\n\\u2014\\u00a0 \\u00a0 $\\n\\u2014\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, before taxes\\n7.5\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\n(0.1) \\u00a0\\nProvision for income taxes\\n\\u2014\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\n\\u2014\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes\\n7.5\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\n(0.1) \\u00a0\\nF-24\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n152/245\"\n",

The Company also considers\\nseveral indicators of impairment, including, among other factors, the following: (i) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner\\nin which a long-lived asset (or asset group) is being used; (ii) a projection or forecast that demonstrates losses associated with the use\\nof a long-lived asset (or asset group); and (iii) whether there exists a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset\\n(or asset group) will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.

The approximate $188\\u00a0million of\\nnet proceeds from the 2019 Term Loan Facility (after taking into account approximately $12\\u00a0million of related fees and expenses) were\\nused for general corporate purposes. The 2019 Term Loan Facility will mature on the earliest of: (x) August 6, 2023; (y) the 180th day\\nprior to the stated maturity of Products Corporation\\u2019s existing 2016 Term Loan Facility, if any loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility\\nremain outstanding and have not been replaced or refinanced by such date; and (z) the date of any springing maturity of the 2016 Term\\nLoan Facility (i.e., the 91st day prior to the maturity of the 5.75% Senior Notes due February 15, 2021 if any 5.75% Senior Notes\\nremain outstanding by such date and certain liquidity thresholds are not met).\\nGuarantees and Security: Products Corporation and its restricted subsidiaries under the 2019 Term Loan Facility (collectively, the\\n\\u201cRestricted Group\\u201d) are subject to the covenants under the 2019 Term Loan Agreement.

The obligations of Revlon, Products Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors under the 2019 Term Loan\\nFacility are secured by pledges of the equity of Products Corporation and the equity of the Restricted Group held by Products\\nCorporation and each subsidiary guarantor (subject to customary exceptions, including equity of first-tier foreign subsidiaries in excess\\nof 66% of the voting equity interests of such entity) and by substantially all tangible and intangible personal and real property of\\nProducts Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors (subject to customary exclusions). The 2019 Term Loan Facility and the existing\\n2016 Term Loan Facility share the same guarantors and collateral, except that the 2019 Term Loan Facility is also secured by a first-\\npriority lien on certain intellectual property of the American Crew business (the \\u201cAdditional Collateral\\u201d) and is guaranteed by the\\nentities established to hold such Additional Collateral. Pursuant to a first lien pari passu intercreditor agreement, dated August 6, 2019,\\namong Revlon, Products Corporation, the subsidiary guarantors, Wilmington Trust and Citibank, N.A. (acting as administrative agent\\nand collateral agent for the 2016 Term Loan Facility), the liens on the shared collateral securing the 2019 Term Loan Facility rank pari\\npassu in priority with the liens on the shared collateral securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility.\\nLicense Agreement: In connection with the pledge of such Additional Collateral, Products Corporation entered into intercompany\\narrangements pursuant to which the Additional Collateral was contributed to a newly-formed subsidiary, Beautyge I, which then further\\ncontributed the Additional Collateral to its new wholly-owned subsidiary, Beautyge II, LLC. Products Corporation entered into a\\nlicense and royalty arrangement on arm\\u2019s length terms with Beautyge II, LLC to provide for the Company\\u2019s continued use of the\\nAdditional Collateral during the term of the 2019 Term Loan Facility.\\nInterest and Fees: Interest accrues on the 2019 Term Loan Facility at a rate per annum of one-month adjusted LIBOR (which has a\\nfloor of 0%) plus a margin of 9.50%. Products Corporation is also obligated to pay customary fees and expenses in connection with the\\n2019 Term Loan Facility.\\u00a0\\nF-32\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n165/245\"\n",

The 2016 Revolving Credit\\nAgreement provided that the \\u201cLiquidity Amount\\u201d (defined in the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement as the sum of each\\nborrowing base less the sum of (x) the aggregate outstanding extensions of credit under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility,\\nand (y) any availability reserve in effect on such date) may exceed the aggregate commitments under the Amended 2016 Revolving\\nCredit Facility by up to 5%. Amendment No. 2 limits the Liquidity Amount to no more than the aggregate commitments under the\\nAmended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. Under the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement, a \\u201cLiquidity Event Period\\u201d generally occurred\\nif Products Corporation\\u2019s Liquidity Amount fell below the greater of $35\\u00a0million and 10% of the maximum availability under the 2016\\nRevolving Credit Facility. Amendment No. 2 changed these thresholds to $50\\u00a0million and 15%, respectively, only for purposes of\\ntriggering certain notification obligations of Products Corporation, increased borrowing base reporting frequency and the ability of the\\nadministrative agent to apply amounts collected in controlled accounts for the repayment of loans under the Amended 2016 Revolving\\nCredit Facility. After entering into Amendment No. 2, in March 2019 Products Corporation\\u2019s availability under the Amended 2016\\nRevolving Credit Facility was $37.3\\u00a0million, which was less than the greater of $35\\u00a0million and 10% of the maximum availability\\nunder the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, which at such date equated to $41.3\\u00a0million. Accordingly, effective beginning in\\nMarch 2019 Products Corporation is required to maintain a FCCR of a minimum of 1.0 to 1.0 (which it currently satisfies), the\\nadministrative agent may apply amounts collected in controlled accounts for the repayment of loans under the Amended 2016\\nRevolving Credit Facility, which the administrative agent began applying in March 2019, and Products Corporation is required to\\nprovide the administrative agent with weekly borrowing base certificates. Products Corporation will be required to: (i) maintain such\\n1.0 to 1.0 minimum FCCR until such time that availability under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility equals or exceeds the\\ngreater of $35\\u00a0million and 10% of the maximum availability under such facility for at least 20 consecutive business days; and (ii)\\nProducts Corporation will continue to provide the administrative agent with weekly borrowing base certificates and the administrative\\nagent may continue to apply amounts collected in controlled accounts as set forth above in each case until such time that availability\\nunder such facility is equal or exceeds the greater of $50\\u00a0million and 15% of the maximum availability under such facility for at least\\n20 consecutive business days.

The\\nCompany does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\\nForeign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts\\nThe FX Contracts may, from time to time, be entered into primarily to hedge the anticipated net cash flows resulting from\\ninventory purchases and intercompany payments denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of the Company\\u2019s foreign\\nand domestic operations and generally have maturities of less than one year. The Company did not enter into any FX Contracts during\\n2019. The U.S. Dollar notional amounts of the FX Contracts outstanding at each of December\\u00a031, 2019 and December\\u00a031, 2018 were\\nnil.\\nInterest Rate Swap Transaction\\nIn November 2013, Products Corporation executed a forward-starting floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction (the \\\"2013\\nInterest Rate Swap\\\") that, at its inception, was based on a notional amount of $400 million in respect of indebtedness under Products\\nCorporation\\u2019s 2013 bank term loan that was incurred in connection with completing the October 2013 acquisition of The Colomer\\nGroup (the \\\"Old Acquisition Term Loan\\\" and the \\\"Colomer Acquisition,\\\" respectively). The 2013 Interest Rate Swap, which initially\\nhad a floor of 1.00% that in December 2016 was amended to 0.75%, expired in May 2018. In connection with entering into the 2016\\nTerm Loan Facility, the 2013 Interest Rate Swap was carried over to apply to a notional amount of $400 million in respect of\\nindebtedness under such loan for the remaining balance of the term of such swap. The Company initially designated the 2013 Interest\\nRate Swap as a cash flow hedge of the variability of the forecasted 3-month LIBOR interest rate payments initially related to the $400\\nmillion notional amount under the Old Acquisition Term Loan over the 3-year term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap (and subsequently\\nto the $400 million notional amount under the 2016 Term Loan Facility). Under the terms of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap, Products\\nCorporation received from the counterparty a floating interest rate based on the higher of the 3-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR or the floor\\npercentage in effect, while paying a fixed interest rate payment to the counterparty equal to 2.0709% (which, with respect to the 2016\\nTerm Loan Facility, effectively fixed the interest rate on such notional amount at 5.5709% through May 2018).\\nAs a result of completely refinancing the Old Acquisition Term Loan with a portion of the proceeds from Product's Corporation's\\nconsummation of the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities and the issuance of its 6.25% Senior Notes in connection with consummating the\\nElizabeth Arden Acquisition, the critical terms of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap no longer matched the terms of the underlying debt\\nunder the 2016 Term Loan Facility. At the refinancing date, which was the same as the September 7, 2016 Elizabeth Arden Acquisition\\nDate (the \\\"De-designation Date\\\"), the 2013 Interest Rate Swap was determined to no longer be highly effective and the Company\\ndiscontinued hedge accounting for the 2013 Interest Rate Swap. Following the de-designation of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap, changes\\nin fair value of such swap were accounted for as a component of other non-operating expenses. Accumulated deferred losses of $6.3\\nmillion, or $3.9 million net of tax, at the De-designation Date, that were previously recorded as a component of accumulated other\\ncomprehensive loss, were fully amortized into earnings over the remaining term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap, which expired in May\\n2018. See \\\"Quantitative Information \\u2013 Derivative Financial Instruments\\\" below for additional information on the balance sheet\\nbalances related to this swap.\\nCredit Risk\\nExposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties to the Company's derivative instruments is\\nlimited to the gross fair value of these derivative instruments in asset positions, which was nil at each of December\\u00a031, 2019 and\\nDecember\\u00a031, 2018. The Company attempts to minimize exposure to credit risk by generally entering into derivative contracts with\\ncounterparties that have investment-grade credit ratings and are major financial institutions. The Company also periodically monitors\\nany changes in the credit ratings of its counterparties.\\nF-46\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n185/245\"\n",

      "  \"content\": \"Table of Contents\\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n(except where otherwise noted, all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\\nEffective December 31, 2015, the Company adopted the \\\"full yield curve\\\" method as an alternative approach to calculating the\\nservice and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefits. Under the\\n\\\"full yield curve\\\" method, the discount rate assumption was built through the application of specific spot rates along the yield curve\\nused in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows for each of the Company's pension and other\\npost-retirement plans. Prior to December 31, 2015, the Company estimated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single\\nweighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the\\nperiod. The change did not affect the measurement of the Company's total projected benefit obligations, as the change in service and\\ninterest costs was exactly offset in the actuarial loss (gain) recognized for each year. The Company made this change to provide a more\\nprecise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the\\ncorresponding spot yield curve rates. The change to the \\\"full yield curve\\\" method was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate\\nthat was inseparable from a change in accounting principle, and accordingly, was accounted for prospectively.\\nIn selecting its expected long-term rate of return on its pension plan assets, the Company considers a number of factors, including,\\nwithout limitation, recent and historical performance of pension plan assets, the pension plan portfolios' asset allocations over a variety\\nof time periods compared with third-party studies, the performance of the capital markets in recent years and other factors, as well as\\nadvice from various third parties, such as the pension plans' advisors, investment managers and actuaries. While the Company\\nconsidered both the recent performance and the historical performance of pension plan assets, the Company\\u2019s assumptions are based\\nprimarily on its estimates of long-term, prospective rates of return. Using the aforementioned methodologies, the Company selected a\\n6.00% and 4.86% weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption during 2019 for the U.S. and International\\npension plans, respectively. Differences between actual and expected asset returns are recognized in the net periodic benefit cost over\\nthe remaining service period of the active participating employees.\\nThe rate of future compensation increases is an assumption used by the actuarial consultants for pension accounting and is\\ndetermined based on the Company\\u2019s current expectation for such increases.\\nInvestment Policy:\\nThe Investment Committee for the Company's U.S. pension plans (the \\\"Investment Committee\\\") has adopted (and revises from\\ntime-to-time) an investment policy for the Company's U.S. pension plans with the objective of realizing a long-term rate of return on\\npension plan assets that meets or exceeds, over time, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, weighed against a\\nreasonable risk level. In connection with this objective, the Investment Committee retains a professional investment advisor who\\nrecommends investment managers that invest plan assets in the following asset classes: common and preferred stock, mutual funds,\\nfixed income securities, common and collective funds, hedge funds, group annuity contracts and cash and other investments. The\\nCompany\\u2019s International plans follow a similar methodology in conjunction with local actuarial consultants and asset managers.\\nThe investment policy adopted by the Investment Committee provides for investments in a broad range of publicly-traded\\nsecurities, among other things. The investments are in domestic and international stocks, ranging from small to large capitalization\\nstocks, debt securities ranging from domestic and international treasury issues, corporate debt securities, mortgages and asset-backed\\nissues. Other investments may include cash and cash equivalents and hedge funds. The investment policy also allows for investments in\\nprivate equity funds that are not covered in investments described above, provided that the Investment Committee approves any such\\ninvestments prior to their selection. Also, global balanced strategies are utilized to provide for investments in a broad range of publicly-\\ntraded stocks and bonds in both domestic and international markets, as described above. In addition, the global balanced strategies can\\ninclude commodities, provided that the Investment Committee approves any such investments prior to their selection.\\nThe Investment Committee\\u2019s investment policy does not allow the use of derivatives for speculative purposes, but such policy does\\nallow its investment managers to use derivatives for the purpose of reducing risk exposures or to replicate exposures of a particular\\nasset class.\\nThe Company\\u2019s U.S. and International pension plans have target asset allocation ranges that are intended to be flexible guidelines\\nfor allocating the plans\\u2019 assets among various classes of assets. These target ranges are reviewed periodically and considered for\\nreadjustment when an asset class weighting is outside of its target range (recognizing that these are flexible target ranges that may vary\\nfrom time-to-time) with the objective of meeting or exceeding the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, weighed\\nagainst a reasonable risk level. The target ranges per asset class in effect for 2019 were as follows:\\u00a0\\nF-51\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n193/245\"\n",

The Plan classifies\\ncommon and preferred stock investments within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\\n\\u2022\\nMutual funds: The fair values of the investments included in the mutual funds asset class are determined using net asset value\\n(\\u201cNAV\\u201d) provided by the administrator of the funds. The NAV is based on the closing price reported on the major market\\nwhere the individual securities within the mutual fund are traded. The Company classifies mutual fund investments within\\nLevel 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\\n\\u2022\\nFixed income securities: The fair values of the investments included in the fixed income securities asset class are based on a\\ncompilation of primarily observable market information and/or broker quotes. The Company classifies fixed income securities\\ninvestments within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\\n\\u2022\\nCommon and collective funds: The fair values of the investments included in the common and collective funds asset class are\\ndetermined using NAV provided by the administrator of the funds. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets\\nowned by the common and collective fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. The\\nredemption frequencies for the investments in the common and collective funds asset class range from daily to monthly, with\\nredemption notice periods that range from 2 to 10 business days. The Company classifies common and collective fund\\ninvestments within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, depending on whether certain criteria are met. Some\\ncommon and collective funds for which fair value is not readily determinable are recorded using NAV per share or its\\nequivalent, as permitted by the practical expedient, provided by ASU No. 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820):\\nDisclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset per Share (or Its Equivalent) (the \\u201cASU No. 2015-07\\npractical expedient\\u201d). These investments are not assigned a fair value hierarchy level.\\n\\u2022\\nHedge funds: The hedge funds asset class includes hedge funds that primarily invest in a grouping of equities, fixed income\\ninstruments, currencies, derivatives and/or commodities. The fair values of investments included in the hedge funds class are\\ndetermined using NAV provided by the administrator of the funds. The hedge fund investments in the hedge funds asset class\\nmay employ leverage, generally can be sold on a quarterly or monthly basis and have redemption notice periods that range up\\nto 90 business days. Hedge fund investments are generally recorded using NAV per share or its equivalent, as permitted by the\\nASU No. 2015-07 practical expedient, and are not assigned a fair value hierarchy level.\\n\\u2022\\nCash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents are measured at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company\\nclassifies cash and cash equivalents within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n194/245\"\n",

For any deferred tax asset\\nin excess of the amount for which it is more likely than not that the Company will realize a benefit, the Company establishes a\\nvaluation allowance. A valuation allowance is a non-cash charge, and it in no way limits the Company's ability to utilize its deferred tax\\nassets, including its ability to utilize tax loss and credit carryforward amounts. As of 2019, the Company concluded that, based on the\\nweight of the available positive and negative evidence, it does not require a valuation allowance on its federal deferred tax assets, other\\nthan those associated with the limitation on the deductibility of interest. The Company does have a valuation allowance on deferred tax\\nassets associated with its activity in certain U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions. These conclusions regarding the establishment of\\nvaluation allowances on the Company's deferred tax assets as of the end of 2019 are consistent with the Company's conclusions on such\\nmatters as of the end of 2018. However, if the Company does not generate sufficient taxable income in future periods, its deferred tax\\nassets may not be realizable on a more-likely-than-not basis. In such event, the Company may be required to establish an additional\\nvaluation allowance against its deferred tax assets in future periods, which would materially increase the Company's tax expense in the\\nperiod in which the allowance is recognized and would adversely impact the Company's results of operations and statement of financial\\ncondition in such period. The Company will continue to monitor the circumstances that would require it to establish an additional\\nvaluation allowance on its deferred tax assets. Accordingly, depending on future evidence that may become available, the Company's\\nassessments regarding its valuation allowance position may change.\\nA valuation allowance has been provided for those deferred tax assets for which, in the opinion of the Company's management, it\\nwas more likely than not that a benefit will not be realized. At December\\u00a031, 2019, the deferred tax valuation allowance primarily\\nrepresented amounts for foreign jurisdictions where, as of the end of 2019, the Company had a three-year cumulative loss, and for\\ncertain U.S. state jurisdictions where the Company had tax loss carryforwards and other tax attributes which may expire prior to being\\nutilized. The deferred tax valuation allowance decreased by $2.4\\u00a0 million and increased by $75.0\\u00a0 million during 2019 and 2018,\\nrespectively. The decrease in the deferred tax valuation allowance during 2019 was primarily associated with the write-off of valuation\\nallowances on deferred tax assets no longer available and a release in foreign valuation allowance no longer required, offset by\\nvaluation allowances required on interest deduction limitations and foreign and state tax loss carryforwards for which the Company has\\ndetermined it is more likely than not that it will not receive a benefit. The increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance during 2018\\nwas primarily associated with the interest deduction limitation and foreign and state tax loss carryforwards for which the Company has\\ndetermined it is more likely than not that it will not receive a benefit.\\nAs of December\\u00a031, 2019, the Company had domestic (federal) and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $939.7\\u00a0million, of\\nwhich $310.6\\u00a0 million are foreign and $629.1\\u00a0 million are domestic (federal). These losses expire in future years as follows: 2020-\\n$4.5\\u00a0million; 2021- $2.8\\u00a0million; 2022 and beyond- $615.4\\u00a0million; and unlimited- $317.0\\u00a0million. The Company also has certain state\\nnet operating loss carryforwards that expire between 2020 and 2038. The Company could receive the benefit of such tax loss\\ncarryforwards only to the extent it has taxable income during the carryforward periods in the applicable tax jurisdictions. As of\\nDecember\\u00a0 31, 2019, there were no consolidated federal net operating losses available from the MacAndrews & Forbes Group (as\\nhereinafter defined) from periods prior to the March 25, 2004 deconsolidation (as described below). The Company has acquired entities\\nthat had carryforward balances for tax losses, tax credits and other tax attributes at the time of the acquisition. U.S. federal and certain\\nstate and foreign jurisdictions impose limitations on the amount of these tax losses, tax credits and other carryforward balances that\\nmay be utilized after an acquisition. The Company has evaluated the impact of these limitations and has established a valuation\\nallowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that the Company expects will be realized.\\nThe Company remains subject to examination of its income tax returns in various jurisdictions, including: Spain for the tax years\\nended December 31, 2009 and forward; the U.S. (federal) for the tax years ended June 30, 2016 and forward; Canada for the tax years\\nended December 31, 2012 and forward; Australia for the tax years ended December 31, 2015 and forward; Switzerland for the tax years\\nended June 30, 2014 and forward; Japan for the tax years ended December 31, 2013 and forward; and the U.K. for the tax years ended\\nDecember 31, 2016 and forward.\\nAt December\\u00a031, 2019 and 2018, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $78.0\\u00a0million and $74.7\\u00a0million, respectively,\\nincluding $11.7\\u00a0million and $9.8\\u00a0million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties. Of the $78.0\\u00a0million of unrecognized tax\\nbenefits as of December\\u00a0 31, 2019, $46.1\\u00a0 million would affect the Company's effective tax rate, if recognized, and the remaining\\n$31.9\\u00a0million would affect the Company's deferred tax accounts. The Company classifies interest and penalties as a component of the\\nprovision for income taxes. The Company recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income\\nan expense of $1.9\\u00a0million and $0.8\\u00a0million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n209/245\"\n",

Revlon Holdings (as hereinafter defined in Note 20, \\\"Related Party Transactions - Transfer\\nAgreements\\\"), Revlon, Products Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries, and MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated entered into a tax\\nsharing agreement (as subsequently amended and restated, the \\\"MacAndrews & Forbes Tax Sharing Agreement\\\"), for taxable periods\\nbeginning on or after January 1, 1992 through and including March 25, 2004, during which Revlon and Products Corporation or a\\nsubsidiary of Products Corporation was a member of the MacAndrews & Forbes Group. In these taxable periods, Revlon's and\\nProducts Corporation's federal taxable income and loss were included in such group's consolidated tax return filed by MacAndrews &\\nForbes Incorporated. During such period, Revlon and Products Corporation were also included in certain state and local tax returns of\\nMacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated or its subsidiaries. Revlon and Products Corporation remain liable under the MacAndrews &\\nForbes Tax Sharing Agreement for all such taxable periods through and including March 25, 2004 for amounts determined to be due as\\na result of a redetermination arising from an audit or otherwise, equal to the taxes that Revlon or Products Corporation would otherwise\\nhave had to pay if it were to have filed separate federal, state or local income tax returns for such periods.\\nMacAndrews & Forbes\\u2019 current ownership does not require the Company to file a U.S. federal consolidated tax return with them.\\nHowever, in certain U.S. states and in certain local and foreign jurisdictions the Company is required to file consolidated, combined,\\nunitary or similar returns. The liability for these state, local and foreign liabilities is also governed by the MacAndrews & Forbes Tax\\nSharing Agreement. The Company accounts for its tax liabilities in these jurisdictions as if it were a separate filer, and the Company's\\ntax accounts are presented as if it were a separate filer. During 2019, the Company's cash tax payments included $2.3\\u00a0 million of\\npayments made to MacAndrews & Forbes in connection with these filings, and the Company's ending tax asset, which is a component\\nof prepaid and other current assets, includes an insignificant amount related to future payments to be received from MacAndrews &\\nForbes in connection with these filings.\\nFollowing the closing of the 2004 Revlon Exchange Transactions, Revlon became the parent of a new consolidated group for\\nfederal income tax purposes and Products Corporation's federal taxable income and loss are included in such group's consolidated tax\\nreturns. Accordingly, Revlon and Products Corporation entered into a tax sharing agreement (the \\\"Revlon Tax Sharing Agreement\\\")\\npursuant to which Products Corporation is required to pay to Revlon amounts equal to the taxes that Products Corporation would\\notherwise have had to pay if Products Corporation were to file separate federal, state or local income tax returns, limited to the amount,\\nand payable only at such times, as Revlon will be required to make payments to the applicable taxing authorities.\\nF-62\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n211/245\"\n",

The Company\\nbelieves that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on\\nthe Company\\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. However, in light of the uncertainties\\ninvolved in legal proceedings generally, the ultimate outcome of a particular matter could be material to the Company\\u2019s operating\\nresults for a particular period depending on, among other things, the size of the loss or the nature of the liability imposed and the level\\nof the Company\\u2019s income for that particular period.\\n20. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\\nAs of December\\u00a031, 2019, MacAndrews & Forbes beneficially owned approximately 87.1% of Revlon's Class A Common Stock,\\nwhich at such date was Revlon's only class of capital stock outstanding. As a result, MacAndrews & Forbes is able to elect Revlon\\u2019s\\nentire Board of Directors and control the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of Revlon's stockholders. MacAndrews & Forbes is\\nbeneficially owned by Ronald O. Perelman.

(\\\"Revlon Holdings\\\"), and which is an\\naffiliate and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes, and certain of Revlon Holdings\\u2019 wholly-owned\\nsubsidiaries. Revlon and Products Corporation also entered into a real property asset transfer agreement with Revlon Holdings.\\nPursuant to such agreements, in June 1992, Revlon Holdings transferred certain assets to Products Corporation and Products\\nCorporation assumed all of the liabilities of Revlon Holdings, other than certain specifically excluded assets and liabilities (the\\nliabilities excluded are referred to as the \\\"Excluded Liabilities\\\"). Certain consumer products lines sold in demonstrator-assisted retailers\\nconsidered not integral to the Company's business and that historically had not been profitable and certain other assets and liabilities\\nwere retained by Revlon Holdings. Revlon Holdings agreed to indemnify Revlon and Products Corporation against losses arising from\\nthe Excluded Liabilities, and Revlon and Products Corporation agreed to indemnify Revlon Holdings against losses arising from the\\nliabilities assumed by Products Corporation. The amounts reimbursed by Revlon Holdings to Products Corporation for the Excluded\\nLiabilities was $0.2\\u00a0million for each of 2019 and 2018. As of both December\\u00a031, 2019 and December\\u00a031, 2018, a receivable balance of\\n$0.1 million from MacAndrews & Forbes was included in the Company\\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets for the Excluded Liabilities.\\nThe net activity related to transactions subject to the Transfer Agreements during 2019 and 2018 was $0.3\\u00a0 million expense and\\n$0.9\\u00a0million income, respectively. As of December\\u00a031, 2019 and December\\u00a031, 2018, a payable balance of $0.2\\u00a0million to, and a\\nreceivable balance of $0.4\\u00a0million from, MacAndrews & Forbes, respectively, was included in the Company\\u2019s Consolidated Balance\\nSheets for transactions subject to the Transfer Agreements.\\nReimbursement Agreements\\nRevlon, Products Corporation and MacAndrews & Forbes have entered into reimbursement agreements (the \\\"Reimbursement\\nAgreements\\\") pursuant to which: (i) MacAndrews & Forbes is obligated to provide (directly or through its affiliates) certain\\nprofessional and administrative services, including, without limitation, employees, to the Company, and to purchase services from\\nthird-party providers, such as insurance, legal, accounting and air transportation services, on behalf of the Company, to the extent\\nrequested by Products Corporation; and (ii) Products Corporation is obligated to provide certain professional and administrative\\nservices, including, without limitation, employees, to MacAndrews & Forbes and to purchase services from third-party providers, such\\nas insurance, legal and accounting services, on behalf of MacAndrews & Forbes, to the extent requested by MacAndrews & Forbes,\\nprovided that in each case the performance of such services does not cause an unreasonable burden to MacAndrews & Forbes or\\nProducts Corporation, as the case may be.\\nThe Company reimburses MacAndrews & Forbes for the allocable costs of the services that MacAndrews & Forbes purchases for\\nor provides to the Company and for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that MacAndrews & Forbes incurs in connection with the\\nprovision of such services. MacAndrews & Forbes reimburses Products Corporation for the allocable costs of the services that Products\\nCorporation purchases for or provides to MacAndrews & Forbes and for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Products\\nCorporation in connection with the purchase or provision of such services. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and MacAndrews &\\nForbes, on the other, has agreed to indemnify the other party for losses arising out of the services provided by it under the\\nReimbursement Agreements, other than losses resulting from its willful misconduct or gross negligence.\\nThe Reimbursement Agreements may be terminated by either party on 90 days' notice. The Company does not intend to request\\nservices under the Reimbursement Agreements unless their costs would be at least as favorable to the Company as could be obtained\\nfrom unaffiliated third parties.\\nThe Company participates in MacAndrews & Forbes' directors and officers liability insurance program (the \\\"D&O Insurance\\nProgram\\\"), as well as its other insurance coverages, such as property damage, business interruption, liability and other coverages,\\nwhich cover the Company, as well as MacAndrews & Forbes and its subsidiaries. The limits of coverage for certain of the policies are\\navailable on an aggregate basis for losses to any or all of the participating companies and their respective directors and officers.

The Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program includes rightsizing the organization and\\noperating with more efficient workflows and processes. The leaner organizational structure is also expected to improve communication\\nflow and cross-functional collaboration, leveraging the more efficient business processes.\\nAs a result of the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program, the Company expects to eliminate approximately 1,000 positions\\nworldwide, including approximately 650 current employees and approximately 350 open positions. In March 2020, the Company\\nbegan informing certain employees that will be affected by the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program. While certain aspects of the\\nRevlon 2020 Restructuring Program may be subject to consultations with employees, works councils, unions and/or governmental\\nauthorities, the Company currently expects to substantially complete the employee-related actions by the end of 2020 and the other\\nconsolidation and outsourcing actions during 2021 and 2022.\\nIn connection with implementing the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program, the Company expects to recognize during 2020\\napproximately $55\\u00a0 million to $65\\u00a0 million of total pre-tax restructuring and related charges (the \\u201c2020 Restructuring Charges\\u201d),\\nconsisting primarily of employee-related costs, such as severance, retention and other contractual termination benefits. In addition the\\nCompany expects, restructuring charges in the range of $65\\u00a0million to $75\\u00a0million to be charged and paid in the period of 2021 to 2022.\\nThe Company expects that substantially all of these restructuring charges will be paid in cash, with approximately $55\\u00a0 million to\\n$65\\u00a0million of the total charges expected to be paid in 2020, approximately $40\\u00a0million to $45\\u00a0million expected to be paid in 2021,\\nwith the balance expected to be paid in 2022.\\nAs a result of the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program, the Company expects to deliver in the range of $200\\u00a0 million to\\n$230\\u00a0million of annualized cost reductions by the end of 2022, with approximately 60% of these annualized cost reductions to be\\nrealized from the headcount reductions occurring in 2020.

The \\nresulting court battles can destroy value \\nand threaten massive liability for the \\ncompany\\u2014and, in some cases, liability \\nfor directors and officers personally.\\nJust this year, litigation over liability \\nmanagement transactions has been \\nfront and center in two high-profile \\nbankruptcy cases, one involving Revlon \\nInc. and the other Serta Simmons \\nBedding LLC. These and other recent \\ncases can illuminate key lessons for \\ndirectors and officers who are exploring, \\nnegotiating, or defending similar \\nliability management transactions.\\nRevlon\\nRevlon, the well-known multinational \\nbeauty company, issued $1.8 billion \\nin secured term loans under a 2016 \\ncredit agreement.1 The 2016 facility was \\nsecured, in part, by liens on Revlon\\u2019s \\nintellectual property in beauty brands. \\nIn late 2019, Revlon approached the \\n2016 facility lenders for new money to \\naddress its severe liquidity needs. The \\nnew transaction\\u2014a type commonly \\ncalled a drop-down transaction\\u2014would \\ntransfer IP collateral under the 2016 \\nfacility to unrestricted subsidiaries, \\nknown as BrandCos, that would not be \\nsubject to the 2016 credit agreement. \\nThe transferred collateral could then \\nbe pledged to secure new debt. \\n \\nThe BrandCo transaction required \\namendments to the 2016 credit \\nagreement, which only a majority of \\nthe 2016 facility debtholders could \\napprove. The lenders splintered into \\ntwo groups\\u2014one group of lenders \\n(BrandCo lenders) agreed to support \\nthe transaction, while a group of \\ndissenting lenders organized to block \\nthe necessary amendments. After \\nfailing to win an initial vote on the \\ndeal, the BrandCo lenders funded $65 \\nmillion in new incremental revolving \\nloans under the 2016 facility. With \\nthe votes from the incremental \\nloans, the BrandCo lenders now held \\na bare majority of the 2016 facility \\ndebt, and the transaction closed. \\nThe BrandCo lenders provided $880 \\nmillion of new money and rolled \\nup their existing 2016 facility debt \\ninto the new, super-senior facility.\\nThe new financing gave Revlon \\nbreathing room, though it ultimately \\nfiled for bankruptcy in 2022. \\nCertain dissenting lenders then \\nfiled an adversary proceeding in \\nthe bankruptcy court to unwind the \\nBrandCo transaction. (Revlon and \\nthe BrandCo lenders filed a motion \\nto dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs \\nlacked standing because any claim \\nseeking equitable relief would be an \\nestate cause of action belonging to \\nthe Revlon debtors. The bankruptcy \\ncourt sided with Revlon, dismissing \\nall claims against the debtors \\nand all claims for equitable relief. \\nAfter that decision, the dissenting \\nlenders settled their dispute with the \\ndebtors and the BrandCo lenders. \\nSerta Simmons Bedding\\nOne of the largest bedding \\nmanufacturers and distributors in North \\nAmerica, Serta Simmons Bedding issued \\n$1.95 billion in first-lien secured term \\nloans under a 2016 credit agreement. \\nLike Revlon, Serta began exploring \\noptions for additional financing in \\nlate 2019. The company ultimately \\ncompleted an exchange transaction with \\na group of participating lenders using an \\nuptier exchange structure. The company \\nchose that proposal over a competing \\nproposal from a second group of \\nexcluded lenders who were not allowed \\nto take part in this exchange transaction.\\nIn the uptier exchange, the participating \\nlenders\\u2014who held a majority of \\nfirst-lien term loans and thus could \\napprove amendments to the 2016 credit \\nagreement\\u2014amended the contract to \\npermit the issuance of higher-priority \\ndebt. The participating lenders then \\nexchanged their old term loans for \\nthe new, higher-priority debt, while \\nthe excluded lenders retained their \\nold, now lower-priority debt. The \\ntransaction structure was different \\nthan the Revlon deal, but the practical \\neffect was similar\\u2014the transaction \\nsubordinated the excluded lenders\\u2019 \\nfirst-priority lien on valuable collateral. \\nSome excluded lenders unsuccessfully \\nsought to enjoin the transaction in New \\nYork state court before it closed. After \\nthe deal closed, a group of excluded \\nlenders filed suit in federal court in the \\nSouthern District of New York (SDNY). \\nThe district court denied a motion \\nto dismiss and allowed claims for \\nbreach of contract and breach of the \\nimplied covenant of good faith and \\nfair dealing to proceed to discovery. \\nIn January 2023, Serta filed for \\nbankruptcy in Texas. The bankruptcy \\nfiling allowed Serta to stay the \\nSDNY action and file an adversary \\nproceeding seeking the bankruptcy \\ncourt\\u2019s blessing of the exchange \\ntransaction. In the bankruptcy court, \\nthe excluded lenders argued both \\nthat the transaction violated the 2016 \\ncredit agreement\\u2019s text and that it \\nbreached the implied covenant of \\ngood faith and fair dealing. Contrary \\nto the earlier decision in the SDNY \\naction, the bankruptcy court ruled \\nthat the exchange transaction was \\nunambiguously permitted under the \\ncredit agreement. Then, in June, after \\na trial, the bankruptcy court rejected \\nthe excluded lenders\\u2019 claims of bad \\nfaith and again ruled that the 2020 \\nexchange transaction was valid.\\ncontinued from page 17\\nPQ\\nCreditor-on-creditor violence has sparked an \\narms race between creditors seeking to restrict \\nflexibility in debt documents and other creditors \\n(and borrowers) seeking ever more ingenious \\nways to find cracks in those documents\\u2019 armor.\"\n",

      "  \"content\": \"Journal of \\nCorporate \\nRenewal\\n19\\nNovember\\n2023\\nPitfalls & Considerations\\nDirectors and officers of distressed \\ncompanies considering new financing \\ndeals that pit existing creditors \\nagainst each other should proceed \\ncautiously. As recent situations show, \\nliability management transactions \\ncan be hotly contested. Directors and \\nofficers should bear in mind their \\nfiduciary duties when evaluating \\nor negotiating such transactions.\\nD&O Responsibilities. Directors and \\nofficers owe fiduciary duties to the \\ncorporation and its shareholders\\u2014to \\nact in good faith, with loyalty, and with \\ndue care. The duty of loyalty requires \\ndirectors and officers to prioritize the \\ninterest of the corporation over their \\nown. The duty of care requires directors \\nand officers to take an active and direct \\nrole in major corporate decisions and \\nto consider all material information \\nreasonably available. In Delaware, a \\nrelated duty of oversight also requires \\ndirectors and officers to make a good \\nfaith effort to monitor risks, be properly \\ninformed, and not ignore red flags. \\nFor financing transactions, directors \\nshould carefully monitor the actions \\nof the company\\u2019s management and \\nfinancial and legal advisors. In addition \\nto understanding the substance \\nof advisors\\u2019 recommendations, \\ndirectors should also probe whether \\nadvisors have any conflicts of \\ninterest that may taint their work.\\nDisgruntled creditors may sue directors \\nand officers for breaching these duties \\nif they approve a liability management \\ntransaction for an insolvent company. \\nIn 2007, the Delaware Supreme Court \\nheld that creditors may bring derivative \\nclaims against directors and officers \\nfor breach of fiduciary duty on behalf \\nof the insolvent corporation once \\na corporation is truly insolvent. (By \\ncontrast, directors and officers do \\nnot owe any duties to creditors when \\nthe corporation is merely trending \\ntoward insolvency.) As the Revlon \\ncase demonstrates, however, if a \\ncompany later files for bankruptcy, \\nobjecting lenders must satisfy standing \\nrequirements to pursue derivative \\nclaims on behalf of the debtors. \\nThe bar for obtaining derivative \\nstanding in bankruptcy is high. The \\ncreditor typically must show that the \\nclaim is colorable and that the debtor-\\nin-possession unjustifiably refused to \\nbring suit on its own. But this standard \\nis by no means insurmountable, \\nand courts have granted creditors \\nderivative standing to pursue breach \\nof fiduciary duty claims against \\ndirectors and officers. Directors and \\nofficers should also be aware that \\nexisting D&O liability insurance may \\nnot cover claims by creditors, as some \\npolicies include creditor exclusions.\\nTo fulfill their duties, directors and \\nofficers should begin analysis of a \\nliability management transaction \\nwith a close review of existing debt \\ndocuments to understand what may \\nbe permitted under the contract. \\nCourts are likely to look first to the \\ncontractual language in deciding any \\ndispute. For example, in rejecting \\nthe excluded lenders\\u2019 arguments, the \\nSerta bankruptcy court emphasized \\nthat it cannot rewrite the contract \\nand explained that the parties \\ncould have avoided the situation \\nwith the addition of a sentence or \\ntwo in the credit agreement.\\nConsiderations for Directors \\nand Officers When Negotiating a \\nTransaction. How negotiations were \\nconducted can play an important role \\nin later litigation. Evidence that the \\ncompany conspired with participating \\nlenders to deprive excluded lenders \\nof their bargain can bolster excluded \\nlenders\\u2019 litigating position. A borrower\\u2019s \\ndirectors and officers should consider \\nthe following when negotiating a \\ncontentious creditor transaction. \\nFirst, open dialogue with all creditor \\ngroups is essential. Soliciting \\nproposals from many lenders will \\nimprove the competitiveness of the \\nfinancing deal and demonstrate that \\ndirectors and officers complied with \\ntheir fiduciary duties by conducting a \\nthorough process for raising capital. \\nBoth Revlon and Serta, for example, \\nallowed multiple existing lender \\ngroups to submit financing proposals. \\nInvolving all lenders also means \\nthat more parties will share their \\nunderstanding of what is permitted \\nby the existing debt documents. \\nEvidence that the dissenting lenders \\nhad recognized the permissibility \\nof the challenged transaction can \\nundercut later claims of bad faith. \\nIn the Serta case, for example, \\nthe bankruptcy court rejected the \\nexcluded lenders\\u2019 bad faith claims \\nin large part because the excluded \\nlenders had earlier proposed their own \\ntransaction using a similar structure. \\nBy contrast, in another well-known \\nrecent litigation over a liability \\nmanagement transaction involving \\nthe apparel company Boardriders, \\na New York state court allowed bad \\nfaith claims challenging a liability \\nmanagement transaction to proceed \\nto discovery in part because the \\nexcluded lenders had reached out to the \\ncompany repeatedly without response.\\nSecond, where possible, directors and \\nofficers should make the new financing \\ndeal available to all lenders. Revlon used \\nevidence that the BrandCo transaction \\nwas open to all lenders to undercut \\nallegations that the transaction was \\nintended to benefit only a subset \\nof lenders. By contrast, the court in \\nBoardriders cited evidence of secretive \\ndiscussions with participating lenders \\nas potential evidence of bad faith.\\n \\nThird, directors and officers should \\nattempt to ensure broad participation in \\nthe new financing deal. A transaction \\neffectuated with a bare majority is \\nmore susceptible to challenge. In the \\nRevlon transaction, the BrandCo lenders \\nobtained a bare majority through the \\nissuance of the incremental revolver, \\nand that issue became a focal point \\nin the ensuing litigation, with the \\ndissenting lenders calling the revolver \\na sham. Obtaining a broader base of \\nsupport for a potentially controversial \\ntransaction will prevent such arguments \\nand improve the chances that a court \\nwill approve the transaction if need be.\\nThese steps will not only help directors \\nand officers avoid liability\\u2014they will \\nalso help the company avoid potential \\nliability. As the Revlon and Serta cases \\ndemonstrate, creditors are likely to \\nargue that a transaction breached the \\nimplied covenant of good faith and fair \\ndealing, as a back-up or in addition \\nto their breach of contract claims. \\nWhether such bad faith claims may \\nbe viable when contesting liability, \\nmanagement transactions is still an \\nopen question. On the one hand, the \\ncontract language can be the end of \\nthe story, as a New York state court \\nexplained in a similar case involving \\nTrimark, the food services provider. \\nOn the other hand, courts have \\nallowed good faith claims to proceed \\nto discovery and trial, as was the case \\nfor Serta and Boardriders. Ensuring an \\nopen, transparent, and fair process for \\na liability management transaction will \\nhelp demonstrate the company\\u2019s good \\nfaith and minimize the risk of liability \\nfor breach of the good faith covenant.\\ncontinued on page 20\"\n",

A company\\u2019s financial \\ndistress may persist after a liability \\nmanagement transaction. If directors \\nand officers are assessing bankruptcy, \\nan additional consideration may \\nbe whether a bankruptcy court \\ncould resolve pending disputes \\nabout the transaction faster and \\nmore cheaply than elsewhere. \\nWith Revlon, the bankruptcy court \\nordered an accelerated litigation \\nschedule\\u2014approximately four months \\nbetween when the complaint was \\nfiled and the anticipated start of trial. \\nThe bankruptcy court rejected the \\nplaintiffs\\u2019 proposed year-long timetable \\nbecause the claims at issue threatened \\nRevlon\\u2019s entire capital structure and \\nthus needed to be resolved before \\nany Chapter 11 plan was confirmed. \\nFiling for bankruptcy can also help \\na debtor place the dispute before \\na bankruptcy judge who may give \\ngreater deference to the debtor\\u2019s \\nreorganization strategy. For example, \\nSerta\\u2019s bankruptcy petition stayed \\npending lawsuits challenging the \\nexchange transaction, including the \\nSDNY action, which had allowed breach \\nof contract and bad faith claims to \\nproceed to discovery. The Serta debtors \\nand participating lenders effectively \\ngot a second chance to litigate the \\nclaims by filing for bankruptcy. \\nLike in Revlon, the bankruptcy \\ncourt adjudicated the Serta dispute \\nquickly, less than six months after \\nthe complaint had been filed. By \\ncontrast, the SDNY action had \\nbeen pending for two years and \\ndepositions had not even taken place. \\nIt appears as though no bankruptcy \\ncourt has recently invalidated a \\nliability management transaction. \\nWhile that hardly guarantees that \\nbankruptcy courts will bless future \\ntransactions, it provides a powerful \\nreason to consider the advantages of \\nChapter 11 in litigation over contested \\nliability management deals. \\nA decision from a bankruptcy court \\nalso offers more finality.

Seiden\\nClient Alerts/Reports October 2022\\nRecipients of an erroneous $500 million wire transfer that had the financial world buzzing must return the\\nfunds, a U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit panel held on Sept. 8, reversing a New York federal\\ndistrict court ruling.\\nIn 2020, Citibank N.A. erroneously transmitted the funds to loan managers for certain lenders on a $1.8\\nbillion seven-year syndicated loan to Revlon Inc. The $500 million error paid off Revlon’s outstanding\\nprincipal balance three years before the company’s loan repayment was due. Citibank, the administrative\\nagent for the lenders, asked the lenders to return the funds. While a number of the lenders participating in\\nthe syndicate did return the funds received upon Citibank’s request, some refused. In a suit filed by\\nCitibank to seek the return of the erroneous payments, the district court ruled that the lenders did not\\nneed to return the money—a ruling that caused great concern within the financial community. As a\\nconsequence, administrative agents and the lawyers representing them began including in credit\\nagreements express “erroneous payment” language, which required lenders to return erroneous\\npayments to the administrative agent.\\nRecently, the Second Circuit determined that the lower court erred in deciding the loan managers did not\\nhave to return the money. The “discharge-for-value” rule did not in fact shield the loan managers from\\nCitibank’s restitution claims because they were on inquiry notice of the mistake, wrote Judge Pierre N.\\nLeval in an opinion joined by Judges Robert D. Sack and Michael H. Park. Judge Park also wrote a\\nseparate concurrence.\\xa0\\nThe circumstances around the erroneous transfer showed red warning flags that would have prompted “a\\nreasonably prudent person” who faced an avoidable risk of loss to look into whether the transfer resulted\\nfrom a mistake.

The transaction occurred at a time when, because Revlon was insolvent, loan\\nparticipations were trading at 20% to 30% of the face amount. (Revlon later filed for Chapter 11\\nbankruptcy, on June 15, 2022.)\\nCitibank discovered the erroneous transmission the next day and issued a total of four recall notices over\\nthe next few days, requesting that the loan managers return the portion representing the principal.\\nHowever, certain loan managers, representing $500 million in debt, refused to return the funds.\\nDischarge-for-Value Rule\\nCitibank sued those loan managers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.\\nFollowing a bench trial, the district court concluded that the rule of discharge-for-value protected the loan\\nmanagers from Citibank’s restitution suit, relying on Banque Worms v. BankAmerica International.\\xa0\\nIn Banque Worms, the New York Court of Appeals upheld a lender’s right to retain a bank’s mistaken\\nrepayment to the bank’s client of a loan that was due and payable. The Court of Appeals based its ruling\\non the American Law Institute’s discharge-for-value rule, published at Section 14 of the Restatement\\n(First) of Restitution (Am. Law Inst. 1937).

It concluded that the defendants established the elements of the discharge-for-value\\ndefense because (1) the lenders were creditors of Revlon on the date of the mistaken payment, (2) each\\nlender was owed in principal and interest the exact amount of money it received from Citibank, (3) neither\\nthe lenders nor the loan managers made misrepresentations to induce the mistaken wire transfers, and\\n(4) neither the lenders nor the loan managers were on notice of Citibank’s mistake.\\nOn appeal to the Second Circuit, Citibank raised several arguments challenging the discharge-for-value\\nrule and the applicability of Banque Worms to this case.\\nConstructive Notice\\nCitibank argued the loan managers could not claim the benefit of the discharge-for-value rule because\\nthey were on notice of a mistake.\\nThe panel agreed. Under New York law, the discharge-for-value rule does not shield the beneficiary of a\\nmistaken transfer from claims for restitution if the beneficiary is on inquiry notice of the mistake. Further,\\nbased on the facts available to the loan managers on Aug. 11, the standard of inquiry notice was satisfied.\\n“The facts were sufficiently troublesome that a reasonably prudent investor would have made reasonable\\ninquiry and reasonable inquiry would have revealed that the payment was made in error,” the panel\\nwrote.\\xa0\\nThe loan managers were aware of four red warning flags that suggested a mistake:\\na. The absence of prior notice of a prepayment, to which the lenders were contractually entitled.\\nb. The inability of the insolvent Revlon to make a repayment of close to $1 billion.\\nc. The fact that the loan was trading at 20 to 30 cents on the dollar, so it could have been retired far more\\ncheaply than by paying its full value.\\nd. Revlon’s attempt just four days earlier to avoid acceleration of the loan’s maturity by making an\\nexchange offer to holders of the 2021 notes.\\nFurther, the district court’s ruling depended on its factual findings that the loan managers believed in\\ngood faith that the payments they received were not a mistake and on its conclusion that those beliefs\\nwere reasonable. The panel said the district court’s reasoning represented a misunderstanding of the\\ninquiry notice test.\\n“The test is not whether the recipient of the mistaken payment reasonably believed that the payment was\\ngenuine and not the result of mistake.

In this case, calling Citibank would have been an easy\\nand obvious way to confirm any suspicion that the wire transfer payment was a mistake. A loan manager\\nwho failed to call Citibank or Revlon but relied instead on nothing more than confirming that the payment\\nmatched the debt did not conduct a reasonable investigation, the panel said.\\xa0\\nHaving failed to make those calls, the loan managers were chargeable with notice of what they would\\nhave learned. Therefore, the panel concluded, the loan managers were on notice of Citibank’s mistake and\\nwere thus ineligible to claim the discharge-for-value defense.\\nBanque Worms Ruling\\nThe panel also agreed with Citibank’s contention that the loan managers were not protected by the\\nBanque Worms ruling because on Aug. 11, they were not entitled to the money they received from\\nCitibank, since Revlon’s debt was not yet payable.\\nThe plaintiff in Banque Worms was entitled to the money because the loan at issue was payable and the\\ndefendant demanded payment. The loan in this case was not payable for three more years, the panel\\nexplained. The Banque Worms decision highlighted the finality of wire transfers, but it did not give a\\nhigher value to finality over all other values.\\xa0\\nOn the contrary, the Banque Worms court explicitly left standing New York’s basic rule requiring the return\\nof the mistaken payments except where identified exceptions apply. It also provided exceptions to the\\ndenial of restitution based on factors such as when the transferee made misrepresentations or had notice\\nof the mistake, said the panel.\\nAdditional Comments\\nJudge Leval wrote an addendum to the opinion, questioning whether an accidental payment of the kind\\nmade by Citibank comes within the scope of the Restatement’s discharge-for-value rule.\\xa0\\nThe Restatement rule applies in circumstances where the transferor’s payment resulted from his “mistake\\n. . . as to his interests or duties.” Citibank was not mistaken as to its interests or duties. Its only mistake\\nwas making a wire transfer setting error, said Judge Leval. Therefore, the discharge-for-value rule has no\\napplication to the payment made in this case, which was an accidental payment made without intent to\\npay, without intent to discharge a debt or lien and without mistake as to the transferor’s duties or\\ninterests, he said.\\xa0\\n3/7/25, 1:48 PM\\nSecond Circuit Reverses Ruling, Says Mistaken $500 Million Wire Transfer Paying Off Revlon Loan Must Be Returned | Loeb & Loeb…\\nhttps://www.loeb.com/en/insights/publications/2022/10/second-circuit-reverses-ruling-500-million-wire-transfer-paying-off-revlon-loan-returned\\n4/6'}\n",

The \\nresulting court battles can destroy value \\nand threaten massive liability for the \\ncompany—and, in some cases, liability \\nfor directors and officers personally.\\nJust this year, litigation over liability \\nmanagement transactions has been \\nfront and center in two high-profile \\nbankruptcy cases, one involving Revlon \\nInc. and the other Serta Simmons \\nBedding LLC. These and other recent \\ncases can illuminate key lessons for \\ndirectors and officers who are exploring, \\nnegotiating, or defending similar \\nliability management transactions.\\nRevlon\\nRevlon, the well-known multinational \\nbeauty company, issued $1.8 billion \\nin secured term loans under a 2016 \\ncredit agreement.1 The 2016 facility was \\nsecured, in part, by liens on Revlon’s \\nintellectual property in beauty brands. \\nIn late 2019, Revlon approached the \\n2016 facility lenders for new money to \\naddress its severe liquidity needs. The \\nnew transaction—a type commonly \\ncalled a drop-down transaction—would \\ntransfer IP collateral under the 2016 \\nfacility to unrestricted subsidiaries, \\nknown as BrandCos, that would not be \\nsubject to the 2016 credit agreement. \\nThe transferred collateral could then \\nbe pledged to secure new debt. \\n \\nThe BrandCo transaction required \\namendments to the 2016 credit \\nagreement, which only a majority of \\nthe 2016 facility debtholders could \\napprove. The lenders splintered into \\ntwo groups—one group of lenders \\n(BrandCo lenders) agreed to support \\nthe transaction, while a group of \\ndissenting lenders organized to block \\nthe necessary amendments. After \\nfailing to win an initial vote on the \\ndeal, the BrandCo lenders funded $65 \\nmillion in new incremental revolving \\nloans under the 2016 facility. With \\nthe votes from the incremental \\nloans, the BrandCo lenders now held \\na bare majority of the 2016 facility \\ndebt, and the transaction closed. \\nThe BrandCo lenders provided $880 \\nmillion of new money and rolled \\nup their existing 2016 facility debt \\ninto the new, super-senior facility.\\nThe new financing gave Revlon \\nbreathing room, though it ultimately \\nfiled for bankruptcy in 2022. \\nCertain dissenting lenders then \\nfiled an adversary proceeding in \\nthe bankruptcy court to unwind the \\nBrandCo transaction. (Revlon and \\nthe BrandCo lenders filed a motion \\nto dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs \\nlacked standing because any claim \\nseeking equitable relief would be an \\nestate cause of action belonging to \\nthe Revlon debtors. The bankruptcy \\ncourt sided with Revlon, dismissing \\nall claims against the debtors \\nand all claims for equitable relief. \\nAfter that decision, the dissenting \\nlenders settled their dispute with the \\ndebtors and the BrandCo lenders. \\nSerta Simmons Bedding\\nOne of the largest bedding \\nmanufacturers and distributors in North \\nAmerica, Serta Simmons Bedding issued \\n$1.95 billion in first-lien secured term \\nloans under a 2016 credit agreement. \\nLike Revlon, Serta began exploring \\noptions for additional financing in \\nlate 2019. The company ultimately \\ncompleted an exchange transaction with \\na group of participating lenders using an \\nuptier exchange structure. The company \\nchose that proposal over a competing \\nproposal from a second group of \\nexcluded lenders who were not allowed \\nto take part in this exchange transaction.\\nIn the uptier exchange, the participating \\nlenders—who held a majority of \\nfirst-lien term loans and thus could \\napprove amendments to the 2016 credit \\nagreement—amended the contract to \\npermit the issuance of higher-priority \\ndebt. The participating lenders then \\nexchanged their old term loans for \\nthe new, higher-priority debt, while \\nthe excluded lenders retained their \\nold, now lower-priority debt. The \\ntransaction structure was different \\nthan the Revlon deal, but the practical \\neffect was similar—the transaction \\nsubordinated the excluded lenders’ \\nfirst-priority lien on valuable collateral. \\nSome excluded lenders unsuccessfully \\nsought to enjoin the transaction in New \\nYork state court before it closed. After \\nthe deal closed, a group of excluded \\nlenders filed suit in federal court in the \\nSouthern District of New York (SDNY). \\nThe district court denied a motion \\nto dismiss and allowed claims for \\nbreach of contract and breach of the \\nimplied covenant of good faith and \\nfair dealing to proceed to discovery. \\nIn January 2023, Serta filed for \\nbankruptcy in Texas. The bankruptcy \\nfiling allowed Serta to stay the \\nSDNY action and file an adversary \\nproceeding seeking the bankruptcy \\ncourt’s blessing of the exchange \\ntransaction. In the bankruptcy court, \\nthe excluded lenders argued both \\nthat the transaction violated the 2016 \\ncredit agreement’s text and that it \\nbreached the implied covenant of \\ngood faith and fair dealing. Contrary \\nto the earlier decision in the SDNY \\naction, the bankruptcy court ruled \\nthat the exchange transaction was \\nunambiguously permitted under the \\ncredit agreement. Then, in June, after \\na trial, the bankruptcy court rejected \\nthe excluded lenders’ claims of bad \\nfaith and again ruled that the 2020 \\nexchange transaction was valid.\\ncontinued from page 17\\nPQ\\nCreditor-on-creditor violence has sparked an \\narms race between creditors seeking to restrict \\nflexibility in debt documents and other creditors \\n(and borrowers) seeking ever more ingenious \\nways to find cracks in those documents’ armor.'}\n",

As recent situations show, \\nliability management transactions \\ncan be hotly contested. Directors and \\nofficers should bear in mind their \\nfiduciary duties when evaluating \\nor negotiating such transactions.\\nD&O Responsibilities. Directors and \\nofficers owe fiduciary duties to the \\ncorporation and its shareholders—to \\nact in good faith, with loyalty, and with \\ndue care. The duty of loyalty requires \\ndirectors and officers to prioritize the \\ninterest of the corporation over their \\nown. The duty of care requires directors \\nand officers to take an active and direct \\nrole in major corporate decisions and \\nto consider all material information \\nreasonably available. In Delaware, a \\nrelated duty of oversight also requires \\ndirectors and officers to make a good \\nfaith effort to monitor risks, be properly \\ninformed, and not ignore red flags. \\nFor financing transactions, directors \\nshould carefully monitor the actions \\nof the company’s management and \\nfinancial and legal advisors. In addition \\nto understanding the substance \\nof advisors’ recommendations, \\ndirectors should also probe whether \\nadvisors have any conflicts of \\ninterest that may taint their work.\\nDisgruntled creditors may sue directors \\nand officers for breaching these duties \\nif they approve a liability management \\ntransaction for an insolvent company. \\nIn 2007, the Delaware Supreme Court \\nheld that creditors may bring derivative \\nclaims against directors and officers \\nfor breach of fiduciary duty on behalf \\nof the insolvent corporation once \\na corporation is truly insolvent. (By \\ncontrast, directors and officers do \\nnot owe any duties to creditors when \\nthe corporation is merely trending \\ntoward insolvency.) As the Revlon \\ncase demonstrates, however, if a \\ncompany later files for bankruptcy, \\nobjecting lenders must satisfy standing \\nrequirements to pursue derivative \\nclaims on behalf of the debtors. \\nThe bar for obtaining derivative \\nstanding in bankruptcy is high. The \\ncreditor typically must show that the \\nclaim is colorable and that the debtor-\\nin-possession unjustifiably refused to \\nbring suit on its own. But this standard \\nis by no means insurmountable, \\nand courts have granted creditors \\nderivative standing to pursue breach \\nof fiduciary duty claims against \\ndirectors and officers. Directors and \\nofficers should also be aware that \\nexisting D&O liability insurance may \\nnot cover claims by creditors, as some \\npolicies include creditor exclusions.\\nTo fulfill their duties, directors and \\nofficers should begin analysis of a \\nliability management transaction \\nwith a close review of existing debt \\ndocuments to understand what may \\nbe permitted under the contract. \\nCourts are likely to look first to the \\ncontractual language in deciding any \\ndispute. For example, in rejecting \\nthe excluded lenders’ arguments, the \\nSerta bankruptcy court emphasized \\nthat it cannot rewrite the contract \\nand explained that the parties \\ncould have avoided the situation \\nwith the addition of a sentence or \\ntwo in the credit agreement.\\nConsiderations for Directors \\nand Officers When Negotiating a \\nTransaction. How negotiations were \\nconducted can play an important role \\nin later litigation. Evidence that the \\ncompany conspired with participating \\nlenders to deprive excluded lenders \\nof their bargain can bolster excluded \\nlenders’ litigating position. A borrower’s \\ndirectors and officers should consider \\nthe following when negotiating a \\ncontentious creditor transaction. \\nFirst, open dialogue with all creditor \\ngroups is essential. Soliciting \\nproposals from many lenders will \\nimprove the competitiveness of the \\nfinancing deal and demonstrate that \\ndirectors and officers complied with \\ntheir fiduciary duties by conducting a \\nthorough process for raising capital. \\nBoth Revlon and Serta, for example, \\nallowed multiple existing lender \\ngroups to submit financing proposals. \\nInvolving all lenders also means \\nthat more parties will share their \\nunderstanding of what is permitted \\nby the existing debt documents. \\nEvidence that the dissenting lenders \\nhad recognized the permissibility \\nof the challenged transaction can \\nundercut later claims of bad faith. \\nIn the Serta case, for example, \\nthe bankruptcy court rejected the \\nexcluded lenders’ bad faith claims \\nin large part because the excluded \\nlenders had earlier proposed their own \\ntransaction using a similar structure. \\nBy contrast, in another well-known \\nrecent litigation over a liability \\nmanagement transaction involving \\nthe apparel company Boardriders, \\na New York state court allowed bad \\nfaith claims challenging a liability \\nmanagement transaction to proceed \\nto discovery in part because the \\nexcluded lenders had reached out to the \\ncompany repeatedly without response.\\nSecond, where possible, directors and \\nofficers should make the new financing \\ndeal available to all lenders. Revlon used \\nevidence that the BrandCo transaction \\nwas open to all lenders to undercut \\nallegations that the transaction was \\nintended to benefit only a subset \\nof lenders. By contrast, the court in \\nBoardriders cited evidence of secretive \\ndiscussions with participating lenders \\nas potential evidence of bad faith.\\n \\nThird, directors and officers should \\nattempt to ensure broad participation in \\nthe new financing deal. A transaction \\neffectuated with a bare majority is \\nmore susceptible to challenge. In the \\nRevlon transaction, the BrandCo lenders \\nobtained a bare majority through the \\nissuance of the incremental revolver, \\nand that issue became a focal point \\nin the ensuing litigation, with the \\ndissenting lenders calling the revolver \\na sham. Obtaining a broader base of \\nsupport for a potentially controversial \\ntransaction will prevent such arguments \\nand improve the chances that a court \\nwill approve the transaction if need be.\\nThese steps will not only help directors \\nand officers avoid liability—they will \\nalso help the company avoid potential \\nliability. As the Revlon and Serta cases \\ndemonstrate, creditors are likely to \\nargue that a transaction breached the \\nimplied covenant of good faith and fair \\ndealing, as a back-up or in addition \\nto their breach of contract claims. \\nWhether such bad faith claims may \\nbe viable when contesting liability, \\nmanagement transactions is still an \\nopen question. On the one hand, the \\ncontract language can be the end of \\nthe story, as a New York state court \\nexplained in a similar case involving \\nTrimark, the food services provider. \\nOn the other hand, courts have \\nallowed good faith claims to proceed \\nto discovery and trial, as was the case \\nfor Serta and Boardriders. Ensuring an \\nopen, transparent, and fair process for \\na liability management transaction will \\nhelp demonstrate the company’s good \\nfaith and minimize the risk of liability \\nfor breach of the good faith covenant.\\ncontinued on page 20'}\n",

A company’s financial \\ndistress may persist after a liability \\nmanagement transaction. If directors \\nand officers are assessing bankruptcy, \\nan additional consideration may \\nbe whether a bankruptcy court \\ncould resolve pending disputes \\nabout the transaction faster and \\nmore cheaply than elsewhere. \\nWith Revlon, the bankruptcy court \\nordered an accelerated litigation \\nschedule—approximately four months \\nbetween when the complaint was \\nfiled and the anticipated start of trial. \\nThe bankruptcy court rejected the \\nplaintiffs’ proposed year-long timetable \\nbecause the claims at issue threatened \\nRevlon’s entire capital structure and \\nthus needed to be resolved before \\nany Chapter 11 plan was confirmed. \\nFiling for bankruptcy can also help \\na debtor place the dispute before \\na bankruptcy judge who may give \\ngreater deference to the debtor’s \\nreorganization strategy. For example, \\nSerta’s bankruptcy petition stayed \\npending lawsuits challenging the \\nexchange transaction, including the \\nSDNY action, which had allowed breach \\nof contract and bad faith claims to \\nproceed to discovery. The Serta debtors \\nand participating lenders effectively \\ngot a second chance to litigate the \\nclaims by filing for bankruptcy. \\nLike in Revlon, the bankruptcy \\ncourt adjudicated the Serta dispute \\nquickly, less than six months after \\nthe complaint had been filed. By \\ncontrast, the SDNY action had \\nbeen pending for two years and \\ndepositions had not even taken place. \\nIt appears as though no bankruptcy \\ncourt has recently invalidated a \\nliability management transaction. \\nWhile that hardly guarantees that \\nbankruptcy courts will bless future \\ntransactions, it provides a powerful \\nreason to consider the advantages of \\nChapter 11 in litigation over contested \\nliability management deals. \\nA decision from a bankruptcy court \\nalso offers more finality.

The Company\\'s research and development group is comprised of departments specialized in the\\ntechnologies critical to many of the Company\\'s product lines. The Company also utilizes specialty laboratories and manufacturers in its\\nsupply chain for the development of certain new products, such as fragrances and skin care. The Company continues to refine its\\nrigorous process for the ongoing development and evaluation of new product concepts, led by executives in marketing, sales, research\\nand development, and including input from operations, law and finance. This process has created a comprehensive, long-term portfolio\\nstrategy that is intended to optimize the Company\\'s ability to regularly launch innovative new product offerings and to effectively\\nmanage the Company’s product portfolio.\\nThe Company operates an extensive research and development facility in Edison, New Jersey for products under brands such as\\nRevlon, Almay and Elizabeth Arden.

A significant portion of Elizabeth Arden\\nproducts were also produced by third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers in the U.S. and Europe.\\nThe Company continually reviews its manufacturing needs against its manufacturing capacities to identify opportunities to reduce\\ncosts and operate more efficiently. The Company purchases raw materials and components throughout the world, and continuously\\npursues reductions in cost of goods through the global sourcing of raw materials and components from qualified vendors, utilizing its\\npurchasing capacity to optimize cost reductions. The Company’s global sourcing strategy for materials and components from qualified\\nvendors is also designed to ensure that the Company maintains a continuous supply of high-quality raw materials and components. The\\nCompany believes that alternate sources of raw materials and components exist and does not anticipate any significant shortages of, or\\ndifficulty in obtaining, such materials.\\nAs previously disclosed, the Company\\'s 2018 net sales were negatively impacted by service level disruptions that occurred at the\\nCompany\\'s Oxford, N.C. manufacturing facility resulting from the Company\\'s launch of a new SAP enterprise resource planning\\n(\"ERP\") system.

In addition, shares of the capital stock of Products Corporation, Revlon\\'s wholly-owned operating subsidiary, are pledged\\nby Revlon to secure its obligations under the 2016 Credit Agreements and the 2019 Term Loan Facility.\\nRevlon is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Revlon\\'s only material asset is all of the outstanding capital\\nstock of Products Corporation, Revlon\\'s wholly-owned operating subsidiary, through which Revlon conducts its business operations. As\\nsuch, Revlon\\'s net income has historically consisted predominantly of its equity in the net loss of Products Corporation, which for 2019\\nand 2018 was $151.2\\xa0million and $289.1\\xa0million, respectively (in each case excluding $7.9\\xa0million and $6.3\\xa0million, respectively, in\\nexpenses primarily related to Revlon being a public holding company). Revlon is dependent on the earnings and cash flow of, and\\ndividends and distributions from, Products Corporation to pay Revlon’s expenses incidental to being a public holding company and to\\npay any cash dividend or distribution on its Class A Common Stock in each case that may be authorized by Revlon’s Board of\\nDirectors.\\nProducts Corporation may not generate sufficient cash flow to pay dividends or distribute funds to Revlon because, for example,\\nProducts Corporation may not generate sufficient cash or net income; state laws may restrict or prohibit Products Corporation from\\nissuing dividends or making distributions unless Products Corporation has sufficient surplus or net profits, which Products Corporation\\nmay not have; or because contractual restrictions, including negative covenants contained in Products Corporation’s various debt\\ninstruments, may prohibit or limit such dividends or distributions.\\nThe terms of Products Corporation\\'s 2016 Credit Agreements, the indentures governing Products Corporation\\'s 6.25% Senior\\nNotes due 2024 (the \"6.25% Senior Notes Indenture\" and the \"6.25% Senior Notes,\" respectively) and 5.75% Senior Notes due 2021\\n(the \"5.75% Senior Notes Indenture\" and the \"5.75% Senior Notes,\" respectively, and, together with the 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture,\\nthe \"Senior Notes Indentures\" and the \"Senior Notes,\" respectively) and the 2019 Term Loan Facility (as hereinafter defined) generally\\nrestrict Products Corporation from paying dividends or making distributions to Revlon, except in limited circumstances. For example,\\nProducts Corporation is permitted to pay dividends and make distributions to Revlon to enable Revlon to, among other things, maintain\\nits existence and its ownership of Products Corporation, such as paying professional fees (e.g., legal, accounting and insurance fees),\\nregulatory fees (e.g., SEC filing fees and NYSE listing fees), pay certain taxes and other expenses related to being a public holding\\ncompany and, subject to certain limitations, to pay dividends, if any, on Revlon’s outstanding securities or make distributions in certain\\ncircumstances to finance Revlon’s purchase of shares of its Class A Common Stock issued in connection with the delivery of such\\nshares to grantees under the Fourth Amended and Restated Revlon, Inc. Stock Plan, as amended. These limitations therefore restrict\\nRevlon\\'s ability to pay dividends on its Class\\xa0A Common Stock.\\nAll of the shares of Products Corporation’s capital stock held by Revlon are pledged to secure Revlon’s guarantee of Products\\nCorporation\\'s obligations under its 2016 Credit Agreements and the 2019 Term Loan Facility. A foreclosure upon the shares of Products\\nCorporation\\'s common stock would result in Revlon no longer holding its only material asset, would have a material adverse effect on\\nthe holders and price of Revlon’s Class A Common Stock and would be a change of control under Products Corporation’s other debt\\ninstruments.

(See also Item 1A. Risk Factors\\n- \"Restrictions and covenants in Products Corporation’s various debt instruments limit its ability to take certain actions and impose\\nconsequences in the event of failure to comply.\")\\nThe Company is subject to the risks normally associated with substantial indebtedness, including the risk that the Company’s\\nprofitability and cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest under Products Corporation’s various\\ndebt instruments, and the risk that Products Corporation will be unable to refinance existing indebtedness when it becomes due or, if it\\nis unable to comply with the financial or operating covenants under its various debt instruments, to obtain any necessary consents,\\nwaivers or amendments or that the terms of any such refinancing and/or consents, waivers or amendments will be less favorable than\\nthe current terms of such indebtedness. Products Corporation’s substantial indebtedness could also have the effect of:\\n•\\nlimiting the Company’s ability to fund (including by obtaining additional financing) the costs and expenses of executing the\\nCompany’s business initiatives, future working capital, capital expenditures, advertising, promotional and/or marketing\\nexpenses, new product development costs, purchases and reconfigurations of wall displays, acquisitions, and related\\nintegration costs, investments, restructuring programs and other general corporate purposes;\\n•\\nrequiring the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on Products\\nCorporation’s indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of the Company’s cash flow necessary for executing the\\nCompany’s business initiatives and for other general corporate purposes;\\n•\\nplacing the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt;\\n•\\nexposing the Company to potential events of default (if not cured or waived) under the financial and operating covenants\\ncontained in Products Corporation’s various debt instruments;\\n•\\nlimiting the Company’s flexibility in responding to changes in its business and the industry in which it operates; and\\n•\\nmaking the Company more vulnerable in the event of adverse economic conditions or a downturn in its business.\\nAlthough agreements governing Products Corporation’s indebtedness, including the 2016 Credit Agreements, the Senior Notes\\nIndentures and the 2019 Term Loan Agreement (as hereinafter defined), limit Products Corporation’s ability to borrow funds, under\\ncertain circumstances Products Corporation is allowed to borrow a significant amount of additional money, some of which, in certain\\ncircumstances and subject to certain limitations, could be secured indebtedness.

While the Amended 2016\\nRevolving Credit Facility provides for up to $441.5 million of commitments, the Company’s ability to borrow funds under such facility\\nis limited by a borrowing base determined relative to the value, from time-to-time, of certain eligible assets.\\nWhile the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility provides for a euro-denominated senior secured asset-based term loan facility\\nin an aggregate principal amount of\\xa0€77 million, the full amount of which was funded on the closing of the facility in July 2018, the\\n2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement requires the maintenance of a borrowing base supporting the borrowing thereunder, based\\non the sum of: (i)\\xa085%\\xa0of eligible accounts receivable; and (ii)\\xa090%\\xa0of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory, in each\\ncase with respect to certain of Products Corporation’s subsidiaries organized in Australia, Bermuda, Germany, Italy, Spain and\\nSwitzerland, subject to certain customary availability reserves.\\nUnder the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility, if the value of the Company\\'s\\neligible assets is not sufficient to support the full borrowing base under the respective facility, Products Corporation will not have\\ncomplete access to the entire commitment available under such facilities, but rather would have access to a lesser amount as determined\\nby the borrowing base.\\nThe Borrowers must prepay loans under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term\\nFacility to the extent that outstanding loans exceed its respective borrowing base Under the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility, in\\nlieu of a mandatory prepayment, the Loan Parties may deposit cash in an amount not to exceed\\xa010%\\xa0of the borrowing base into a\\ndesignated U.S. bank account with the Agent that is subject to a control agreement (such cash, the \"Qualified Cash\"). If any such over-\\nadvance has not been cured within 60 days, the Qualified Cash may be applied, at the Agent’s option, to prepay the loans under the\\n2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility. To the extent certain levels of availability are obtained during a certain period of time, the\\nBorrowers can withdraw the Qualified Cash from such bank account. In addition, the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility is\\nsubject to mandatory prepayments from the net proceeds from the incurrence by the Loan Parties of debt not permitted thereunder.\\nAs Products Corporation continues to manage its working capital (including its and its subsidiaries inventory and accounts\\nreceivable, which are significant components of the eligible assets comprising the borrowing base under the Amended 2016 Revolving\\nCredit Facility and the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility), this could reduce the borrowing base under the Amended 2016\\nRevolving Credit Facility and/or the 2018 Asset-Based Term Facility. Further, if Products Corporation borrows funds under the\\nAmended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, subsequent changes in the value or eligibility of the assets within the borrowing base could\\nrequire Products Corporation to pay down amounts outstanding under such facility so that there is no amount outstanding in excess of\\nthe then-existing borrowing base. Likewise, subsequent changes in the value or eligibility of the assets within the borrowing base under\\nthe 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility could require Products Corporation to pay down amounts outstanding under such facility\\nso that there is no amount outstanding in excess of the then-existing borrowing base, which, unlike the Amended 2016 Revolving\\nCredit Facility, cannot be re-borrowed.\\nThe Company’s ability to borrow under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility is also conditioned upon its compliance with\\nother covenants in the agreements that govern the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities.

As of December\\xa031, 2019, $2,253.6\\xa0million of Products Corporation’s total indebtedness, or approximately 71% of its total\\nindebtedness, was subject to floating interest rates.\\nIn July 2017, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or\\ncompelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. It is unclear whether or not LIBOR will cease to exist at that time (and if so, what\\nreference rate will replace it) or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021.\\nCertain of Products Corporation’s financing agreements, including its 2016 Term Loan Facility, the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit\\nFacility and the 2019 Term Loan Facility are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the applicable\\ninterest rate. While the 2016 Credit Agreements contain limited “fallback” provisions providing for comparable or successor rates in\\nthe event LIBOR is unavailable, these provisions may not adequately address the actual changes to LIBOR or its successor rates. For\\nexample, if future rates based upon the successor reference rate (or a new method of calculating LIBOR) are higher than LIBOR rates\\nas currently determined, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition\\nand/or cash flows. On the other hand, if future rates based upon the successor reference rate (or a new method of calculating LIBOR)\\nare lower than LIBOR rates as currently determined, the lenders under such credit agreements may seek amendments to increase the\\napplicable interest rate margins or invoke their right to require the use of the alternate base rate in place of LIBOR, which could result\\nin an increase to our interest expense as discussed below. By contrast, the 2019 Term Loan Facility does not have provisions for\\nselecting or requiring the alternative base rate, and therefore in the event that LIBOR is discontinued in the future and a comparable or\\nsuccessor rate is not approved by the required lenders under the 2019 Term Loan Facility, it may become necessary to amend the 2019\\nTerm Loan Facility. More generally, a phase-out of LIBOR could cause market volatility or disruption and may adversely affect our\\naccess to the capital markets and cost of funding, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of\\noperations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\\nSimilar considerations as the ones described above with respect to LIBOR as benchmark for establishing interest rates apply to\\nEURIBOR. Our 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility is denominated in Euros and the interest rate thereunder is tied to EURIBOR.\\nTo the extent that EURIBOR becomes unavailable, the agreement contains fallback provisions ultimately providing for a rate\\ndetermined by the administrative agent as the all-in-cost of funds for borrowings denominated in Euros with maturities comparable to\\nthe interest period applicable to the loans under the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility.\\n16\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n28/245\"}\n",

Further, achieving these objectives will require investments, which may result in material short-term costs\\nwithout generating any current net sales and the Company may not ultimately achieve its net sales objectives associated with such\\nefforts. The future expansion of the Fragrances segment through acquisitions, new fragrance licenses, e-commerce initiatives or other\\nnew fragrance distribution arrangements, if any, will depend upon the ability to identify suitable brands to acquire, license or distribute\\nand to obtain the required financing for these acquisitions, licenses or distribution arrangements or to launch or support the brands\\nassociated with these agreements or arrangements.

In addition, the Company may decide to divest or\\ndiscontinue certain brands or streamline operations and may incur costs and charges in doing so. The inability to acquire or license\\nadditional fragrance brands or secure additional distribution arrangements for the Fragrances segment (such as optimizing its e-\\ncommerce sales opportunities) and obtain the required financing for these agreements and arrangements could have an adverse effect\\non the Company’s net sales and a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and/or cash flows.\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n38/245\"}\n",

The Company is exposed to risks associated with social, political and economic conditions, including inflation, inherent\\nin operating in foreign countries, including those in Asia (such as China and Hong Kong, which has been impacted by ongoing political\\nunrest in that region), Australia, Canada, Eastern Europe (such as Russia), Mexico, South Africa and South America (such as\\nArgentina), which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition\\nand/or cash flows. Such risks include hyperinflation, foreign currency devaluation, tariffs, foreign currency controls, government-\\nmandated pricing controls, currency remittance restrictions, changes in tax laws, changes in consumer purchasing habits (including as\\nto retailer preferences), as well as, to a lesser extent, changes in U.S. laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment.\\nThe U.S. and the other countries in which the Company’s products are manufactured or sold have imposed and may impose\\nadditional duties, tariffs and other retaliatory or trade protection measures, or other restrictions or regulations, or may adversely adjust\\nprevailing quota, duty or tariff levels, which can affect the cost and availability of materials that the Company uses to manufacture and\\npackage its products and the sale of finished products. For example, the E.U. has imposed tariffs on certain beauty products imported\\nfrom the U.S., which would impact the sale in the E.U. of certain of the Company’s more prestige products that are manufactured in the\\nU.S. Similarly, the tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods and materials from China would impact any materials that the Company\\nimports from that region for use in manufacturing or packaging in the U.S. Measures that the Company could be required to take to\\nreduce the impact of tariff increases or trade restrictions, including shifts of production among countries and manufacturers,\\ngeographical diversification of the Company’s sources of supply, adjustments in product or packaging design and fabrication, or\\nincreased prices, could increase the Company’s costs and delay the Company’s time to bring its products to shelf. Other governmental\\nactions related to tariffs or international trade agreements have the potential to adversely impact demand for the Company’s products,\\nproduction costs, retail customers and suppliers. These\\xa0risks, which could increase the Company’s costs and reduce the Company’s net\\nsales and profitability, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and/or cash flows.\\nThese risks and limitations could also affect the ability of the Company's foreign subsidiaries to obtain sufficient capital to conduct\\ntheir operations in the ordinary course of business.

Additionally, disruptions in the credit and other financial markets and economic conditions\\ncould, among other things, impair the financial condition of one or more of the Company\\'s customers or suppliers, thereby increasing\\nthe risk of customer bad debts or non-performance by suppliers.

In June\\n2016, a majority of voters in the U.K. elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum. In March 2017, the U.K.\\ngovernment invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union and the U.K. exited the European Union on January 31, 2020. The\\n\"Brexit\" process has created significant ongoing uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.K. and the European Union\\nand has given rise to calls for the governments of other European Union member states to consider withdrawal from the European\\nUnion. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse\\neffect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets and could significantly reduce global market liquidity\\nand restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Asset valuations, currency exchange rates and\\ncredit ratings may be especially subject to increased market volatility. Lack of clarity about future U.K. laws and regulations as the\\nU.K. determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate as the withdrawal process proceeds, including financial laws and\\nregulations, tax and free trade agreements, intellectual property rights, supply chain logistics, environmental, health and safety laws and\\nregulations, immigration laws and employment laws, could decrease foreign direct investment in the U.K., increase costs, depress\\neconomic activity, restrict the Company’s access to capital and make regulatory compliance and the distribution, sourcing,\\nmanufacturing and sales and marketing of the Company’s products more difficult or costly. If the U.K. and the European Union are\\nunable to negotiate acceptable withdrawal terms or if other European Union member states pursue withdrawal, barrier-free access\\nbetween the U.K. and other European Union member states or among the European economic area overall could be diminished or\\neliminated. Similar adverse consequences could occur if regions such as Catalonia, where the Company\\'s Spain businesses are\\nheadquartered, eventually succeed in withdrawing from their parent country. Approximately 4% of the Company\\'s net sales are in the\\nU.K. and approximately 16% of the Company\\'s net sales are in the remainder of the European Union.

These attacks contributed to major\\ninstability in the U.S. and other financial markets and reduced consumer confidence. These terrorist attacks, as well as subsequent\\nterrorist attacks (such as those that have occurred in Berlin, Germany; Nice, France; Orlando, Florida; Istanbul, Turkey; Brussels,\\nBelgium; Paris, France; Benghazi, Libya; Madrid, Spain; London, England and most recently the attack on the U.S. embassy in\\nBaghdad, Iraq and the U.S.\\'s military response to such attack), attempted terrorist attacks, military responses to terrorist attacks, other\\nmilitary actions and/or civil unrest, such as that occurring in France, the Ukraine, Venezuela, Turkey, Syria, Iraq and surrounding areas\\nand, most recently in Hong Kong, may adversely affect prevailing economic conditions, resulting in work stoppages, reduced consumer\\nspending and/or reduced demand for the Company\\'s products.

Such events\\ncould also result in the deterioration of confidence in the Company by employees, consumers and customers and cause other\\ncompetitive disadvantages. In addition, a security or data privacy breach could require the Company to expend significant additional\\nresources to enhance its information security systems and could result in a disruption to the Company’s operations.\\xa0Furthermore, third\\nparties, such as the Company’s suppliers and retail customers, may also rely on information technology and be subject to such\\ncybersecurity breaches.\\xa0These breaches may negatively impact their businesses, which could in turn disrupt the Company’s supply\\nchain and/or the Company’s business operations. Due to the potential significant costs, business disruption and reputational damage\\nthat typically accompany a cyberattack or cybersecurity breach, any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company's\\nbusiness, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\\nThe Company’s information technology systems, or those of its third-party service providers, may be accessed by unauthorized\\nusers such as cyber criminals as a result of a disruption, cyberattack or other security breach. Cyberattacks and other cybersecurity\\nincidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by\\ngroups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives. Such cyberattacks and cyber incidents can take many forms,\\nincluding cyber extortion, social engineering, password theft or introduction of viruses or malware, such as ransomware through\\nphishing emails.\\xa0 As techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, a disruption, cyberattack or other security breach of the\\nCompany’s information technology systems or infrastructure, or those of its third-party service providers, may go undetected for an\\nextended period and could result in the theft, transfer, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss or destruction of\\nCompany, employee, representative, customer, vendor, consumer and/or other third-party data, including sensitive or confidential data,\\npersonal information and/or intellectual property. The Company cannot guarantee that its security efforts will prevent breaches or\\nbreakdowns of the Company’s or its third-party service providers’ information technology systems. In addition, like most major\\ncorporations, the Company's information systems are a target of cyberattacks and although the incidents that the Company has\\nexperienced to date have not had a material effect, if the Company suffers a material loss or disclosure of confidential information as a\\nresult of a breach of its information technology systems, including those of its third-party service providers, the Company may suffer\\nreputational, competitive and/or business harm, incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations, litigation, fines\\nand/or damages, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and/or cash flows.\\nFurther, the Company is subject to an evolving body of federal, state and non-U.S. laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and\\nprinciples regarding data privacy and security. Several governments, including the E.U., have regulations dealing with the collection\\nand use of personal information obtained from their citizens, and regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for\\nprivacy violations. As of May 2018, the European privacy regulation General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) went into effect,\\nstrengthening and expanding the rules pertaining to how organizations are required to handle the personal data of individuals located in\\nthe EU at the time the data is collected. GDPR establishes new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, and non-\\ncompliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of the Company’s worldwide revenue. In addition, the State\\nof California recently enacted a data privacy law applicable to entities serving or employing California residents (the “CCPA”) that will\\nrequire compliance by January 2020. The GDPR, the CCPA and other changes in federal, state and foreign laws, rules or regulations\\nassociated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data and other personal information, require the Company to\\nevaluate its current operations, information technology systems and data handling practices and to implement enhancements and\\nadaptations where necessary to comply with these new laws, rules and regulations, which could greatly increase the Company’s\\noperational costs or require the Company to adapt certain operations or activities to comply with the stricter regulatory requirements.\\nThe Company's inability to comply with such laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and principles or to quickly adapt the Company's\\npractices to reflect them as they develop, could potentially subject the Company to significant fines, damages, liabilities and\\nreputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and/or cash flows.\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n45/245\"}\n",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nThe Company previously identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting, which has now been\\nremediated. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on the\\nCompany’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\\nThe Company previously disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, a material\\nweakness in its internal control over financial reporting primarily related to control deficiencies within various aspects of its control\\nenvironment. As a result of these control deficiencies, the Company concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was not\\neffective for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. During 2019, the Company completed a series of actions and measures that\\neffectively remediated the previously-disclosed material weakness and concluded that as of December 31, 2019 its internal control over\\nfinancial reporting was effective. See Item 9A. – “Controls and Procedures” of this 2019 Form 10-K. The Company cannot provide\\nassurances that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not occur in the future and that it will be able to remediate such\\nweaknesses or deficiencies in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects,\\nresults of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\\nFurthermore, if the remediated material weakness recurs in the future or a new material weakness occurs, it could negatively\\nimpact the Company’s ability to prepare its future financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. If the Company were unable to\\nprepare its future financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, such circumstances would expose the Company to potential\\nevents of default (if not cured or waived) under the financial and operating covenants contained in Products Corporation’s various debt\\ninstruments and cause the Company to seek any necessary consents, waivers or amendments from its lenders. Under such\\ncircumstances, Products Corporation faces the risk that it may not be able to obtain any such consents, waivers or amendments, that the\\nterms of any such consents, waivers or amendments will be less favorable than the current terms of its indebtedness and/or Products\\nCorporation may not be able to refinance its existing indebtedness to enable it to repay that indebtedness when it becomes due. See also\\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - “Products Corporation’s substantial indebtedness could adversely affect the Company’s operations and\\nflexibility and Products Corporation’s ability to service its debt,” “Products Corporation’s ability to pay the principal amount of its\\nindebtedness depends on many factors” and “Restrictions and covenants in Products Corporation’s various debt instruments limit its\\nability to take certain actions and impose consequences in the event of failure to comply.” Also, if the Company is unable to prepare its\\nfuture financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, it could result in damage to the Company’s reputation, financial obligations\\nto third parties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation, any or all of which could result in additional business disruptions and the\\nCompany incurring potentially substantial costs.\\nThe Company may not realize the cost reductions and other benefits that it expects from its various restructuring programs that\\nmay be in effect from time to time, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of\\noperations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\\nFrom time to time, the Company implements restructuring program, such as the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program (such\\nprograms as may be in effect from time to time being referred to as “Restructuring Programs”) that are generally designed to streamline\\nthe Company’s operations, reporting structures and business processes, with the objective of maximizing productivity and improving\\nprofitability, cash flows and liquidity. Events and circumstances may occur that are beyond the Company’s control, such as delays\\ncaused by third parties and unexpected costs, that could result in the Company not realizing all of the anticipated cost reductions and\\nbenefits or the Company not realizing the cost reductions or other benefits on its expected timetable. In addition, changes in foreign\\nexchange rates, commodity costs and/or in tax, labor or other laws may result in the Company not achieving the anticipated cost\\nreductions and benefits, as measured in U.S. dollars. If the Company is unable to realize the Restructuring Programs’ cost reduction\\nobjectives and other benefits, the Company’s ability to fund other initiatives and enhance its profitability may be adversely affected. In\\naddition, some of the actions that the Company is taking in furtherance of the Restructuring Programs may become a distraction for the\\nCompany’s managers and employees and may disrupt the Company’s ongoing business operations; cause deterioration in employee\\nmorale which may make it more difficult for the Company to retain or attract qualified employees; disrupt or weaken the Company’s\\ninternal control structures; and/or give rise to negative publicity which could affect the Company’s business reputation. If the Company\\nis unable to successfully implement the Restructuring Programs, in whole or in part, in accordance with the Company’s expectations, it\\ncould adversely affect its business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

(\"Revlon\" and together with its subsidiaries, the \"Company\") conducts its business exclusively through its direct\\nwholly-owned operating subsidiary, Revlon Consumer Products Corporation (\"Products Corporation\"), and its subsidiaries. Revlon is\\nan indirect majority-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated (together with certain of its affiliates other than the\\nCompany, \"MacAndrews & Forbes\"), a corporation beneficially owned by Ronald O. Perelman.\\nThe Company operates in four brand-centric reporting segments that are aligned with its organizational structure based on four\\nglobal brand teams: Revlon; Elizabeth Arden; Portfolio; and Fragrances. The Company manufactures, markets and sells an extensive\\narray of beauty and personal care products worldwide, including color cosmetics; fragrances; skin care; hair color, hair care and hair\\ntreatments; beauty tools; men\\'s grooming products; anti-perspirant deodorants; and other beauty care products.\\nThe Company remains focused on its 3 key strategic pillars to drive its future success and growth. First, strengthening its iconic\\nbrands through innovation and relevant product portfolios; second, building its capabilities to better communicate and connect with its\\nconsumers through media channels where they spend the most time; and third, ensuring availability of its products where consumers\\nshop, both in-store and increasingly online.\\xa0\\nFor additional information regarding the Company\\'s business, see \"Part 1, Item 1 - Business\" in this 2019 Form 10-K.\\nCertain capitalized terms used in this 2019 Form 10-K are defined throughout this Item 7.\\nOverview of Net Sales and Earnings Results\\nConsolidated net sales in 2019 were $2,419.6 million, a $144.9 million decrease, or 5.7%, compared to $2,564.5 million in 2018.\\nExcluding the $55.7 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations (referred herein as \"FX\", \"XFX\" or on an \"XFX\\nbasis\"), consolidated net sales decreased by $89.2 million, or 3.5%, during 2019. The XFX net sales decrease in 2019 was primarily\\ndue to: a $62.8 million, or 11.1%, decrease in Portfolio segment net sales, a $52.1 million, or 10.2%, decrease in Fragrances segment\\nnet sales and a $17.5 million, or 1.8%, decrease in Revlon segment net sales; partially offset by a $43.2 million, or 8.8%, increase in\\nElizabeth Arden segment net sales.\\nConsolidated loss from continuing operations, net of taxes, in 2019 was $165.2 million, compared to consolidated loss from\\ncontinuing operations, net of taxes, of $294.1 million in 2018. The $128.9 million decrease in consolidated loss from continuing\\noperations, net of taxes, in 2019 was primarily due to:\\n•\\n$143.9 million of lower SG&A expenses, primarily driven by lower brand support expenses as a result of planned lower\\nactivity in 2019 and lower general and administrative expenses, primarily driven by cost reductions related to the Company\\'s\\ncost optimization initiatives and lower incentive compensation;\\n•\\na $46.7 million increase in gain on divested assets related to the gain of $27.4\\xa0million recorded in 2019 on the sale of certain\\nassets, compared to a loss on disposal of minority investment of $20.1 million recorded in 2018;\\n•\\nan $18.0 million decrease in non-cash impairment charges related to the goodwill impairment of the Company\\'s Mass\\nportfolio reporting unit within the Portfolio segment recorded in 2018, compared to no goodwill impairment in 2019;\\n•\\n$10.0 million of lower acquisition, integration, and divestiture costs;\\n•\\na $7.4 million decrease in restructuring charges primarily related to lower expenditures under the 2018 Optimization Program\\nin 2019 compared to 2018; and\\n•\\na $2.0 million decrease in the\\xa0 provision from\\xa0 income taxes, primarily due to a decrease in foreign valuation allowances\\nrecorded in 2019, offset by additional tax expense resulting from changes in mix and level of foreign earnings;\\n35\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n53/245'}\n",

The Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program includes rightsizing the organization and\\noperating with more efficient workflows and processes. The leaner organizational structure is also expected to improve communication\\nflow and cross-functional collaboration, leveraging the more efficient business processes.\\nAs a result of the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program, the Company expects to eliminate approximately 1,000 positions\\nworldwide, including approximately 650 current employees and approximately 350 open positions. In March 2020, the Company\\nbegan informing certain employees that will be affected by the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program. While certain aspects of the\\nRevlon 2020 Restructuring Program may be subject to consultations with employees, works councils, unions and/or governmental\\nauthorities, the Company currently expects to substantially complete the employee-related actions by the end of 2020 and the other\\nconsolidation and outsourcing actions during 2021 and 2022.\\nIn connection with implementing the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program, the Company expects to recognize during 2020\\napproximately $55 million to $65 million of total pre-tax restructuring and related charges (the “2020 Restructuring Charges”),\\nconsisting primarily of employee-related costs, such as severance, retention and other contractual termination benefits. In addition the\\nCompany expects, restructuring charges in the range of $65 million to $75 million to be charged and paid in the period of 2021 to 2022.\\nThe Company expects that substantially all of these restructuring charges will be paid in cash, with approximately $55 million to $65\\nmillion of the total charges expected to be paid in 2020, approximately $40 million to $45 million expected to be paid in 2021, with the\\nbalance expected to be paid in 2022.\\nAs a result of the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program, the Company expects to deliver in the range of $200 million to $230\\nmillion of annualized cost reductions by the end of 2022, with approximately 60% of these annualized cost reductions to be realized\\nfrom the headcount reductions occurring in 2020. During 2020, the Company expects to realize approximately $105 million to $115\\nmillion of in-year cost reductions.\\nStrategic Review\\nIn August 2019, it was disclosed that MacAndrews & Forbes and the Company determined to explore strategic transactions\\ninvolving the Company and third parties.

The 2016 Revolving Credit\\nAgreement provided that the “Liquidity Amount” (defined in the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement as the sum of each\\nborrowing base less the sum of (x) the aggregate outstanding extensions of credit under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility,\\nand (y) any availability reserve in effect on such date) may exceed the aggregate commitments under the Amended 2016 Revolving\\nCredit Facility by up to 5%. Amendment No. 2 limits the Liquidity Amount to no more than the aggregate commitments under the\\nAmended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. Under the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement, a “Liquidity Event Period” generally occurred\\nif Products Corporation’s Liquidity Amount fell below the greater of $35\\xa0million and 10% of the maximum availability under the 2016\\nRevolving Credit Facility. Amendment No. 2 changed these thresholds to $50 million and 15%, respectively, only for purposes of\\ntriggering certain notification obligations of Products Corporation, increased borrowing base reporting frequency and the ability of the\\nadministrative agent to apply amounts collected in controlled accounts for the repayment of loans under the Amended 2016 Revolving\\nCredit Facility. After entering into Amendment No. 2, in March 2019 Products Corporation’s availability under the Amended 2016\\nRevolving Credit Facility was $37.3\\xa0million, which was less than the greater of $35\\xa0million and 10% of the maximum availability\\nunder the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, which at such date equated to $41.3\\xa0million. Accordingly, effective beginning in\\nMarch 2019 Products Corporation is required to maintain a FCCR of a minimum of 1.0 to 1.0 (which it currently satisfies), the\\nadministrative agent may apply amounts collected in controlled accounts for the repayment of loans under the Amended 2016\\nRevolving Credit Facility, which the administrative agent began applying in March 2019, and Products Corporation is required to\\nprovide the administrative agent with weekly borrowing base certificates. Products Corporation will be required to: (i) maintain such\\n1.0 to 1.0 minimum FCCR until such time that availability under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility equals or exceeds the\\ngreater of $35\\xa0million and 10% of the maximum availability under such facility for at least 20 consecutive business days; and (ii)\\nProducts Corporation will continue to provide the administrative agent with weekly borrowing base certificates and the administrative\\nagent may continue to apply amounts collected in controlled accounts as set forth above in each case until such time that availability\\nunder such facility is equal or exceeds the greater of $50 million and 15% of the maximum availability under such facility for at least\\n20 consecutive business days. Amendment No. 2 also adjusts, among other things, the “payment conditions” required to make\\nunlimited restricted payments.\\nOperating Segments\\nThe Company operates in four reporting segments: Revlon; Elizabeth Arden; Portfolio; and Fragrances:\\n•\\nRevlon - The Revlon segment is comprised of the Company's flagship Revlon brands.

The Company does have a\\nvaluation allowance on deferred tax assets associated with its activity in certain U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions. These conclusions\\nregarding the establishment of valuation allowances on the Company\\'s deferred tax assets as of the year ended December 31, 2019 are\\nconsistent with the Company\\'s conclusions on such matters as of the year ended December 31, 2018. However, if the Company does\\nnot generate sufficient taxable income in future periods, its deferred tax assets may not be realizable on a more-likely-than-not basis,\\nwhich would result in the Company having to establish an additional valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.

The\\napproximate $188 million of net proceeds from the 2019 Term Loan Facility (after taking into account approximately $12 million of\\nrelated fees and expenses) were used for general corporate purposes. The 2019 Term Loan Facility will mature on the earliest of: (x)\\nAugust 6, 2023; (y) the 180th day prior to the stated maturity of Products Corporation’s existing 2016 Term Loan Facility, if any loans\\nunder the 2016 Term Loan Facility remain outstanding and have not been replaced or refinanced by such date; and (z) the date of any\\nspringing maturity of the 2016 Term Loan Facility (i.e., the 91st day prior to the maturity of the 5.75% Senior Notes due February 15,\\n2021 if any 5.75% Senior Notes remain outstanding by such date and certain liquidity thresholds are not met).\\nGuarantees and Security: Products Corporation and its restricted subsidiaries under the 2019 Term Loan Facility (collectively, the\\n“Restricted Group”) are subject to the covenants under the 2019 Term Loan Agreement. The 2019 Term Loan Facility is guaranteed by\\neach existing and future direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiary of Products Corporation (subject to various\\nexceptions), as well as by Revlon, on a limited recourse basis, and Elizabeth Arden (U.K.) Ltd., Revlon Canada Inc. and Elizabeth\\nArden (Canada) Limited. The obligations of Revlon, Products Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors under the 2019 Term Loan\\nFacility are secured by pledges of the equity of Products Corporation and the equity of the Restricted Group held by Products\\nCorporation and each subsidiary guarantor (subject to customary exceptions, including equity of first-tier foreign subsidiaries in excess\\nof 66% of the voting equity interests of such entity) and by substantially all tangible and intangible personal and real property of\\nProducts Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors (subject to customary exclusions). The 2019 Term Loan Facility and the existing\\n2016 Term Loan Facility share the same guarantors and collateral, except that the 2019 Term Loan Facility is also secured by a first-\\npriority lien on certain intellectual property of the American Crew business (the “Additional Collateral”) and is guaranteed by the\\nentities established to hold such Additional Collateral. Pursuant to a first lien pari passu intercreditor agreement, dated August 6, 2019,\\namong Revlon, Products Corporation, the subsidiary guarantors, Wilmington Trust and Citibank, N.A. (acting as administrative agent\\nand collateral agent for the 2016 Term Loan Facility), the liens on the shared collateral securing the 2019 Term Loan Facility rank pari\\npassu in priority with the liens on the shared collateral securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility.\\nLicense Agreement: In connection with the pledge of such Additional Collateral, Products Corporation entered into intercompany\\narrangements pursuant to which the Additional Collateral was contributed to a newly-formed subsidiary, Beautyge I, which then further\\ncontributed the Additional Collateral to its new wholly-owned subsidiary, Beautyge II, LLC. Products Corporation entered into a\\nlicense and royalty arrangement on arm’s length terms with Beautyge II, LLC to provide for the Company’s continued use of the\\nAdditional Collateral during the term of the 2019 Term Loan Facility.\\nInterest and Fees: Interest accrues on the 2019 Term Loan Facility at a rate per annum of one-month adjusted LIBOR (which has a\\nfloor of 0%) plus a margin of 9.50%. Products Corporation is also obligated to pay customary fees and expenses in connection with the\\n2019 Term Loan Facility.\\nAffirmative and Negative Covenants: The 2019 Term Loan Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants that,\\namong other things, limit the Restricted Group’s ability to: (i) incur additional debt; (ii) incur liens; (iii) sell, transfer or dispose of\\nassets; (iv) make investments; (v) make dividends and distributions on, or repurchases of, equity; (vi) make prepayments of\\ncontractually subordinated or junior lien debt; (vii) enter into certain transactions with their affiliates; (viii) enter into sale-leaseback\\ntransactions; (ix) change their lines of business; (x) restrict dividends from their subsidiaries or restrict liens; (xi) change their fiscal\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n77/245'}\n",

The 2019 Term Loan Agreement also contains additional covenants: (i) restricting the\\nactivities of the entities established to hold the Additional Collateral; (ii) limiting the incurrence of additional secured debt by the\\nRestricted Group to an aggregate principal amount of $50 million (excluding the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and any\\nrefinancing of the 5.75% Senior Notes due 2021); (iii) restricting the transfer by the Restricted Group of material intellectual property\\nto non-guarantor restricted subsidiaries or other affiliates; and (iv) limiting additional investments by Products Corporation and its\\nsubsidiary guarantors in any non-guarantor subsidiary to an outstanding amount of $50 million plus $10 million for ordinary course\\ninvestments consistent with past practice.

Second, Products Corporation’s Consolidated EBITDA cannot be less than $250 million for any test period\\nending on or after March 31, 2021.\\nPrepayments: The 2019 Term Loan Facility is subject to mandatory prepayments from: (i) the net proceeds from the issuance by\\nProducts Corporation or any of its restricted subsidiaries of certain additional debt; (ii) commencing with the excess cash flow\\ncalculation with respect to fiscal year ending December 31, 2020, 50% of excess cash flow, with step-downs to 25% and 0% upon\\nachievement of certain first lien leverage ratios and reduced by voluntary prepayments of the 2019 Term Loan Facility, the 2016 Term\\nLoan Facility and revolving loans under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility (to the extent commitments thereunder are\\npermanently reduced); and (iii) asset sale proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property that have\\nnot been reinvested to the extent in excess of certain minimum amounts (subject to an aggregate reinvestment cap of $50 million).\\nProducts Corporation may voluntarily prepay the 2019 Term Loan Facility at any time. All voluntary prepayments, certain mandatory\\nprepayments and repayments upon acceleration after an event of default of the 2019 Term Loan Facility must be accompanied by a fee\\n(the “Applicable Premium”) in an amount equal to: (i) prior to January 1, 2021, a make-whole amount with respect to interest payments\\nthrough December 31, 2020 plus 10% of the aggregate principal amount prepaid, repaid or required to be repaid; (ii) on and after\\nJanuary 1, 2021, but prior to January 1, 2022, 10% of the aggregate principal amount prepaid, repaid or required to be repaid; (iii) on\\nand after January 1, 2022, but prior to January 1, 2023, 7.5% of the aggregate principal amount prepaid, repaid or required to be repaid;\\nor (iv) thereafter, 5% of the aggregate principal amount prepaid, repaid or required to be repaid. A 5% exit fee is also payable upon the\\nfinal scheduled maturity of the 2019 Term Loan Facility or if the loans thereunder are accelerated upon an event of default. The 2019\\nTerm Loan Agreement also contains certain customary representations, warranties and events of default.\\nEvents of Default: The 2019 Term Loan Agreement includes customary events of default, including a cross default provision\\nmaking it an event of default under the 2019 Term Loan Agreement if there is an event of default under Products Corporation’s existing\\n2016 Credit Agreements, the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement, the Amended 2019 Senior Line of Credit Agreement or the\\nSenior Notes Indentures.

The 2016 Revolving Credit\\nAgreement provided that the “Liquidity Amount” (defined in the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement as the sum of each\\nborrowing base less the sum of (x) the aggregate outstanding extensions of credit under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility,\\nand (y) any availability reserve in effect on such date) may exceed the aggregate commitments under the Amended 2016 Revolving\\nCredit Facility by up to 5%. Amendment No. 2 limits the Liquidity Amount to no more than the aggregate commitments under the\\nAmended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. Under the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement, a “Liquidity Event Period” generally occurred\\nif Products Corporation’s Liquidity Amount fell below the greater of $35 million and 10% of the maximum availability under the 2016\\nRevolving Credit Facility. Amendment No. 2 changed these thresholds to $50 million and 15%, respectively, only for purposes of\\ntriggering certain notification obligations of Products Corporation, increased borrowing base reporting frequency and the ability of the\\nadministrative agent to apply amounts collected in controlled accounts for the repayment of loans under the Amended 2016 Revolving\\nCredit Facility. After entering into Amendment No. 2, in March 2019 Products Corporation’s availability under the Amended 2016\\nRevolving Credit Facility was $37.3 million, which was less than the greater of $35 million and 10% of the maximum availability\\nunder the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, which at such date equated to $41.3 million. Accordingly, effective beginning in\\nMarch 2019 Products Corporation is required to maintain a FCCR of a minimum of 1.0 to 1.0 (which it currently satisfies), the\\nadministrative agent may apply amounts collected in controlled accounts for the repayment of loans under the Amended 2016\\nRevolving Credit Facility, which the administrative agent began applying in March 2019, and Products Corporation is required to\\nprovide the administrative agent with weekly borrowing base certificates. Products Corporation will be required to: (i) maintain such\\n1.0 to 1.0 minimum FCCR until such time that availability under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility equals or exceeds the\\ngreater of $35 million and 10% of the maximum availability under such facility for at least 20 consecutive business days; and (ii)\\nProducts Corporation will continue to provide the administrative agent with weekly borrowing base certificates and the administrative\\nagent may continue to apply amounts collected in controlled accounts as set forth above in each case until such time that availability\\nunder such facility is equal or exceeds the greater of $50 million and 15% of the maximum availability under such facility for at least\\n20 consecutive business days. Amendment No. 2 also adjusts, among other things, the “payment conditions” required to make\\nunlimited restricted payments.\\nThe Company’s foreign operations held $102.5 million out of its total $104.3 million in cash and cash equivalents as of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2019. While the cash held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is primarily used to fund their operations, the Company\\nregularly assesses its global cash needs and the available sources of cash to fund these needs, which regularly includes repatriating\\nforeign-held cash to settle historical intercompany loans and other intercompany payables. The Company believes that it has and will\\nhave sufficient liquidity to meet its cash needs for at least the next 12 months based upon the cash generated by its operations, cash on\\nhand, availability under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, the Amended 2019 Senior Line of Credit Facility, the 2020\\nRefinancing Transactions and other permissible borrowings, along with the option to further settle historical intercompany loans and\\npayables with certain foreign subsidiaries. See “Recent Developments – 2020 Refinancing Transactions” in Item 7. “Combined\\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The Company also expects to generate\\nadditional liquidity from cost reductions resulting from the implementation of the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program and the 2018\\nOptimization Program, which was initiated during the fourth quarter of 2018, and cost reductions generated from other cost control\\ninitiatives, as well as funds provided by selling certain assets (such as the Natural Honey and Floid brands that were sold in December\\n2019) in connection with the Company’s ongoing Strategic Review.

The increase in cash provided by investing activities was related to $31.1 million of proceeds from the sale of\\ncertain assets in 2019, consisting of the Company’s Natural Honey and Floid regional and local brands, and also by lower capital\\nexpenditures in 2019 compared to 2018.\\nFinancing Activities\\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $84.3 million and $233.1 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\nNet cash provided by financing activities during 2019 primarily included:\\n•\\n$200.0 million of borrowings under the 2019 Term Loan Facility;\\nwith the foregoing partially offset by:\\n•\\n$62.6 million of repayments under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility;\\n•\\n$18.0 million of repayments under the 2016 Term Loan Facility;\\n•\\n$17.3 million of decreases in short-term borrowings and overdraft; and\\n•\\n$15.3 million of payments of financing costs incurred in connection with consummating the 2019 Term Loan Facility in\\nAugust 2019 and the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility, which were $14.0\\xa0million and $1.3\\xa0million, respectively.\\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December\\xa031, 2018 primarily included:\\n•\\n$178.0 million of borrowings under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility; and\\n•\\n$88.9 million of borrowings under the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility;\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n80/245'}\n",

In the ordinary course of business, the Company’s source or use of cash from operating activities may vary on\\na quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of working capital flows.\\nContinuing to execute the Company’s business initiatives could include taking advantage of additional opportunities to reposition,\\nrepackage or reformulate one or more brands or product lines, launching additional new products, acquiring businesses or brands\\n(including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), divesting or discontinuing non-core business lines (which may include\\nexiting certain territories), further refining the Company’s approach to retail merchandising and/or taking further actions to optimize its\\nmanufacturing, sourcing and organizational size and structure. Any of these actions, the intended purpose of which would be to create\\nvalue through improving the Company\\'s financial performance, could result in the Company making investments and/or recognizing\\ncharges related to executing against such opportunities. Any such activities may be funded with operating revenues, cash on hand,\\nfunds that may be available from time to time under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, the Amended 2019 Senior Line of\\nCredit Facility, other permissible borrowings, the 2020 Refinancing Transactions and/or other permitted additional sources of capital,\\nwhich actions could increase the Company’s total debt.\\nThe Company may also, from time-to-time, seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt obligations and/or equity in open market\\npurchases, block trades, privately negotiated purchase transactions or otherwise and may seek to refinance some or all of its\\nindebtedness based upon market conditions.

The Company has from time to time in the past attempted to minimize exposure to credit risk by generally\\nentering into derivative contracts with counterparties that have investment-grade credit ratings and are major financial institutions. If\\napplicable, the Company also periodically monitors any changes in the credit ratings of its counterparties.

The physical condition and marketability of the returned products are the major factors the Company\\nconsiders in estimating realizable value. Cost of sales includes the cost of refurbishment of returned products. Actual returns, as well as\\nrealized values on returned products, may differ significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the Company’s estimates if factors\\nsuch as product discontinuances, customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from the Company’s estimates and\\nexpectations and, in the case of actual product returns, if economic conditions differ significantly from the Company’s estimates and\\nexpectations. For returned products that the Company expects to resell at a profit, the Company records, in addition to sales returns as a\\nreduction to sales and cost of sales and an increase to accrued liabilities for the amount expected to be refunded to the customer, an\\nincrease to the asset account used to reflect the Company\\'s right to recover products. The amount of the asset account is valued based\\nupon the former carrying amount of the product (i.e., inventory), less any expected costs to recover the products. As the estimated\\nproduct returns that are expected to be resold at a profit do not comprise a significant amount of the Company\\'s net sales or assets, the\\nCompany does not separately report these amounts.\\nPension Benefits:\\nThe Company sponsors both funded and unfunded pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering employees who\\nmeet the applicable eligibility requirements. The Company uses several statistical and other factors in an attempt to estimate future\\nevents in calculating the liability and net periodic benefit income/cost related to these plans. These factors include assumptions about\\nthe discount rate, expected long-term return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined annually by the\\nCompany, within certain guidelines, which assumptions would be subject to revisions if significant events occur during the year. The\\nCompany uses December 31st as its measurement date for defined benefit pension plan obligations and plan assets.\\nThe Company applies the \"full yield curve\" approach, an alternative approach from the single weighted-average discount rate\\napproach, to calculate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other post-retirement benefits.\\nUnder this method, the discount rate assumption was built through the application of specific spot rates along the yield curve used in\\nthe determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows for each of the Company\\'s pension and other retirement\\nplans.\\nThe Company utilized a 3.01% weighted-average discount rate in 2019 for the Company\\'s U.S. defined benefit pension plans,\\ncompared to a 4.13% weighted-average discount rate in 2018. The Company utilized a 1.81% weighted-average discount rate for the\\nCompany’s international defined benefit pension plans in 2019, compared to a 2.52% weighted-average discount rate selected in 2018.\\nThe discount rates are used to measure the benefit obligations at the measurement date and the net periodic benefit income/cost for the\\nsubsequent calendar year and are reset annually using data available at the measurement date. The changes in the discount rates used\\nfor 2019 were primarily due to observed decreases in long-term interest yields on high-quality corporate bonds during 2019. At\\nDecember 31, 2019, the decrease in the discount rates from December 31,\\xa02018\\xa0had the effect of increasing the Company’s projected\\npension benefit obligation by approximately\\xa0$65.5\\xa0million.\\n60\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n85/245'}\n",

While the Company considered both the recent\\nperformance and the historical performance of plan assets, the Company’s assumptions are based primarily on its estimates of long-\\nterm, prospective rates of return. The difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of\\naccumulated other comprehensive (loss) income and the resulting gains or losses are amortized over future periods as a component of\\nthe net periodic benefit cost. For the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the expected long-term rate of return on the\\npension plan assets used was 6.00% for both 2019 and 2018. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return used for the\\nCompany’s international plans was 4.86% for 2019 and 4.95% for 2018. For 2019, the actual return on pension plan assets was $61.3\\nmillion, as compared with expected return on plan assets of $25.1 million. The resulting net deferred gain of $36.2 million, when\\ncombined with gains and losses from previous years, will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 10 to 30 years. The\\nactual return on plan assets for 2019 was above expectations, primarily due to higher returns from investments in developed equity\\nmarkets, bank loans and bond yields.\\nThe table below reflects the Company’s estimates of the possible effects that changes in the discount rates and expected long-term\\nrates of return would have had on its 2019 net periodic benefit costs and its projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2019 for the\\nCompany’s principal defined benefit pension plans, with all other assumptions remaining constant:\\nEffect of\\nEffect of\\n25 basis points increase\\n25 basis points decrease\\nNet periodic\\nbenefit costs\\nProjected\\npension benefit\\nobligation\\nNet periodic\\nbenefit costs\\nProjected pension\\nbenefit obligation\\nDiscount rate\\n$\\n1.7\\xa0 \\xa0 $\\n(15.6) \\xa0 $\\n1.5\\xa0 \\xa0 $\\n16.3\\xa0 \\xa0\\nExpected long-term rate of return\\n$\\n(0.4) \\xa0 $\\n—\\xa0 \\xa0 $\\n1.8\\xa0 \\xa0 $\\n—\\xa0 \\xa0\\nThe rate of future compensation increases is another assumption used by the Company’s third-party actuarial consultants for\\npension accounting. The rate of future compensation increases used for the Company’s projected pension benefit obligation in both\\n2019 and 2018 was 3.50% for the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Such increase was not applied to the Revlon Employees’\\nRetirement Plan and the Revlon Pension Equalization Plan, as the rate of future compensation increases is no longer relevant to such\\nplans due to plan amendments that effectively froze these plans as of December 31, 2009. During 2019, the UAW Plan was frozen and\\nthe rate of future compensation increase is no longer applicable.\\nIn addition, the Company\\'s actuarial consultants also use other factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The actuarial\\nassumptions used by the Company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or\\nlower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants, among other things. Differences from these assumptions could\\nsignificantly impact the actual amount of net periodic benefit cost and liability recorded by the Company.\\nTo determine the fiscal 2020 net periodic benefit income/cost, the Company is using the \"full yield curve\" approach described\\nabove to separately calculate discount rates for each of the service and interest components. The following table represents the\\nweighted average discount rates used in calculating each component of service and interest costs for the Company\\'s U.S. and\\ninternational defined benefit pension plans:\\nU.S.\\nPlans\\nInternational\\nPlans\\nInterest cost on projected benefit obligation\\n2.58\\xa0%\\n1.95\\xa0 %\\nService cost(a)\\nN/A\\xa0 \\xa0\\n0.32\\xa0 %\\nInterest cost on service cost(a)\\nN/A\\xa0 \\xa0\\n0.16\\xa0 %\\n(a) Service cost and interest on service cost are no longer applicable for the U.S. plans as the UAW Plan was frozen during 2019.\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n86/245'}\n",

The fair values of the acquired\\nintangible assets are primarily calculated using a discounted cash flow approach.\\nDetermining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on evaluating a number of factors, such as\\nmarketplace participants, product life cycles, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations. There are\\nsignificant judgments inherent in a discounted cash flow approach, including in selecting appropriate discount rates, hypothetical\\nroyalty rates, contributory asset capital charges, estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and identifying appropriate\\nterminal growth rate assumptions. The discount rates used in discounted cash flow analyses are intended to reflect the risk inherent in\\nthe projected future cash flows generated by the respective acquired intangible assets.\\nDetermining an acquired intangible asset\\'s useful life requires management judgment and is based on evaluating a number of\\nfactors, including the expected use of the asset, consumer awareness, trade name history and future expansion expectations, as well as\\nany contractual provisions that could limit or extend an asset\\'s useful life. The Company believes that an acquired trade name has an\\nindefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and the Company has the intent and ability to support the\\ntrade name with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If this indefinite-lived criteria is not met, acquired trade names are\\namortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 5 to 20 years.\\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company implemented its brand-centric organizational structure which is built around four global\\nbrand teams: Revlon; Elizabeth Arden; Portfolio; and Fragrances, which also represent the Company\\'s reporting segments. Concurrent\\nwith the change in reporting segments, goodwill was reassigned to the affected reporting units that have been identified within each\\nreporting segment using a relative fair value allocation approach as outlined in Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\")\\n350,\\xa0 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. Goodwill totaled $673.7 million and $673.9 million as of December\\xa0 31, 2019 and 2018,\\nrespectively. As of December\\xa031, 2019, goodwill of $264.9 million, $171.1 million, $116.9 million and $120.8 million related to the\\nRevlon, Portfolio, Elizabeth Arden and Fragrances segments, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangibles totaled $143.8 million and\\n$145.2 million as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\nIn accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), Accounting Standard Codification (\"ASC\") 350, Intangibles\\n- Goodwill and Other (\"ASC 350\"), goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but rather are reviewed annually\\nfor impairment using October 1st carrying values, or when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\\ncurrent carrying amounts may not be recovered. Under this standard, the Company annually has the option to first assess qualitatively,\\nbased on relevant events and circumstances, whether it is more likely than not that there has been an impairment, or perform a\\nquantitative analysis to assess the existence of any such impairment.\\xa0If the qualitative analysis shows that it is more likely than not that\\nthe fair value of a reporting unit is higher than its carrying amount, the quantitative analysis is not required. If the qualitative analysis\\nfails, the quantitative analysis is required. Per the simplified approach allowed under ASU No. 2017-04, \"Simplifying the Test for\\nGoodwill Impairment,\" adopted by the Company as of October 1, 2018, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value\\nof the reporting unit, the goodwill impairment charge is equal to the amount of such difference. The inputs and assumptions utilized in\\nthe analyses are classified as Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.\\nThe Company establishes its reporting units based on its current reporting structure, product characteristics and management.\\nWithin each of the Elizabeth Arden and Portfolio segments, the Company has identified two reporting units. The two reporting units\\nwithin the Elizabeth Arden segment are: (i) Elizabeth Arden Skin and Color, which includes Elizabeth Arden skin care and color\\ncosmetics brands; and (ii) Elizabeth Arden Fragrances, which includes Elizabeth Arden branded fragrances. The two reporting units\\nwithin the Portfolio segment are: (i) Mass Portfolio, which includes the Company\\'s brands sold primarily through the mass retail\\nchannel; and (ii) Professional Portfolio, which includes the Company\\'s brands sold primarily through professional salons. The\\nCompany\\'s Revlon and Fragrances reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 17, \"Segment Data and\\nRelated Information,\" in the Company’s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2019 Form 10-K.

The Company utilized the two-step process\\nin assessing whether goodwill was impaired for each of the Company\\'s six reporting units: (i) Revlon; (ii) Elizabeth Arden Skin and\\nColor; (iii) Elizabeth Arden Fragrances; (iv) Mass Portfolio; (v) Professional Portfolio; and (vi) Fragrances. As a result of this\\nimpairment testing, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of each of these reporting units\\nexceeded their respective carrying amounts.\\nAnnual impairment testing\\nFor 2019, in assessing whether goodwill was impaired in connection with its annual impairment testing performed during the\\nfourth quarter of 2019 using October 1st, 2019 carrying values, the Company, in accordance with ASC 350, performed qualitative\\nassessments for its (i) Revlon, (ii) Elizabeth Arden Skin and Color and (iii) Fragrances reporting units and a quantitative assessment for\\nits (x) Mass Portfolio, (y) Professional Portfolio and (z) Elizabeth Arden Fragrances reporting units.\\nIn performing the 2019 qualitative assessment, the Company considered, among other factors, the financial performance of each of\\nits Revlon, Elizabeth Arden Skin and Color and Fragrances reporting units, as well as the results of the annual quantitative analysis\\nperformed in 2018 for each of these reporting units. Based upon such assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than\\nnot that the fair value of each of its Revlon, Elizabeth Arden Skin and Color and Fragrances reporting units exceeded their respective\\ncarrying amounts for 2019.\\nIn performing the 2019 quantitative assessment, the Company used the simplified approach allowed under ASU No. 2017-04,\\n\"Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,\" which the Company early adopted in October 2018, to test its Mass Portfolio,\\nProfessional Portfolio and Elizabeth Arden Fragrances reporting units for impairment. Based upon such assessment, the Company\\ndetermined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of each of its Mass Portfolio, Professional Portfolio and Elizabeth Arden\\nFragrances reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts for 2019. The fair values of the Company’s reporting units\\nexceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 8% to approximately 58% as of the October 1, 2019 valuation date. The\\nfair values of the Mass Portfolio, Professional Portfolio and Elizabeth Arden Fragrances reporting units are in excess of the respective\\ncarrying values by approximately 8%, 12%, and 12%, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the Mass Portfolio, Professional\\nPortfolio and Elizabeth Arden Fragrances reporting units had goodwill balances of $54.3 million, $116.8 million and $49.4 million,\\nrespectively.\\nThe above-mentioned fair values were determined using a weighted average market and income approach. The income approach\\nrequires several assumptions including future sales growth, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization)\\nmargins, and capital expenditures, which are the basis for the information used in the discounted cash flow model. The key assumptions\\nused to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting unit are predicated on the success of future new product launches, the\\nachievement of international expansion plans, and the realization of cost reduction and other efficiency efforts. If such plans do not\\nmaterialize, or if there are further challenges in the business environment in which this reporting unit operates, a resulting change in the\\nkey assumptions (e.g., long-term financial projections) could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit,\\nand it is possible the Company could recognize an impairment charge.\\nFor 2018, the Company first performed a qualitative assessment on all of its reporting units, which indicated that indicators of\\nimpairment existed for its Mass Portfolio reporting unit within the Portfolio segment. Subsequently, the Company used the simplified\\napproach allowed under ASU No. 2017-04 to test its Mass Portfolio reporting unit for impairment. Following the results of such\\nassessment, the Company recognized an $18.0 million\\xa0non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the Mass Portfolio reporting\\nunit within the Portfolio segment in the fourth quarter of 2018. Following the recognition of this non-cash goodwill impairment charge,\\nthe Mass Portfolio reporting unit had\\xa0$54.3\\xa0million\\xa0in remaining goodwill as of December 31, 2018.\\nFor each of 2019 and 2018, no impairment was recognized related to the carrying value of any of the Company\\'s finite or\\nindefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of the annual impairment testing.\\nSee Note 7, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,\" to the Company\\'s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2019\\nForm 10-K for further information on the Company\\'s goodwill and intangible assets.\\n63\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n89/245'}\n",

The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax-planning opportunities that may be available in various jurisdictions in\\nwhich the Company operates and the Company’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Determining the\\nCompany’s effective tax rate and evaluating tax positions requires significant judgment.\\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future impact of differences between the financial statement\\ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The\\nCompany measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which\\nmanagement expects that the Company will recover or settle those differences. The realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily\\ndependent on forecasted future taxable income. The Company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when\\nmanagement determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize a tax benefit for the deferred tax assets. Any\\nreduction in estimated forecasted future taxable income may require the Company to record valuation allowances against deferred tax\\nassets on which a valuation allowance was not previously established.

The Company recognizes liabilities for\\nunrecognized tax positions in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of whether and the extent to which additional\\ntaxes will be due. If payment of these amounts is ultimately not required, the reversal of the liabilities would result in additional tax\\nbenefits recognized in the period in which the Company determines that the liabilities are no longer required. If the estimate of tax\\nliabilities is ultimately less than the final assessment, this will result in a further charge to expense. The Company recognizes interest\\nand penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2019, the Company is indefinitely reinvested in the accumulated undistributed earnings of all of its foreign\\nsubsidiaries. If earnings are repatriated, any excess of financial reporting over tax basis could be subject to federal, state and foreign\\nwithholding taxes. At this time, the determination of deferred tax liabilities on the amount of financial reporting over tax basis is not\\npracticable.\\nSee Note 14, \"Income Taxes,\" to the Company\\'s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2019 Form 10-K for further\\ninformation.\\nRecently Evaluated and/or Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842)\" (\"ASU 2016-02\" or \"ASC 842\"), which requires\\nlessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a related lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases, with the exception of short-term\\nleases. The lease liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments and the right-of-use asset will be based on the lease\\nliability, subject to certain adjustments, such as initial direct costs.

Further, the new credit loss model will affect how entities in all\\nindustries estimate their allowance for losses for receivables that are current with respect to their payment terms. ASU No. 2018-19\\nfurther clarifies that receivables arising from operating leases are not within the scope of Topic 326. Instead, impairment from\\nreceivables of operating leases should be accounted for in accordance with Topic 842, Leases.

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are\\ndesigned to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\\namended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such\\ninformation is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\\nOfficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company's management, with the participation of\\nthe Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure\\ncontrols and procedures as of the end of the fiscal period covered by this 2019 Form 10-K. Based upon such evaluation, the Company's\\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were\\neffective as of December 31, 2019. Please see section (b) below for a discussion of the Company’s remediation of a previously-reported\\nmaterial weakness.\\n(b) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. The Company’s management is responsible\\nfor establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control system is designed\\nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of published\\nfinancial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of\\nrecords that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of its assets; (ii) provide reasonable\\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of its financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP,\\nand that its receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and (iii)\\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's\\nassets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.\\nDue to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management's\\nprojections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as to future periods are subject to the risks\\nthat controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\\nmay deteriorate. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such\\nthat there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be\\nprevented or detected on a timely basis.\\nThe Company’s management, under the oversight of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the\\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 and in making this assessment used\\nthe criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission Internal Control-Integrated\\nFramework (2013). Based on this assessment, the Company’s management, under the oversight of the Chief Executive Officer and\\nChief Financial Officer, determined that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,\\n2019. Please see below for a discussion of the Company’s remediation of a previously-reported material weakness.\\nKPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company's 2019 Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements for the period ended December 31, 2019 included in this 2019 Form 10-K, has issued a report on the Company's\\ninternal control over financial reporting.

Notwithstanding that material weakness, in preparing its 2018 Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements, the Company performed additional procedures, such as enhanced review procedures over key financial statement\\nline items, enhanced quarterly certifications and enhanced disclosure processes throughout the Company, and determined that the\\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in its 2018 Form 10-K were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and fairly presented\\nin all material respects the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flow for the periods presented. Based on the\\nmaterial weakness that existed as of December 31, 2018, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP,\\nissued an adverse report on the Company’s 2018 internal control over financial reporting.\\nAs a result of the foregoing, throughout 2019, to remediate the material weakness that impacted the fiscal year ended December\\n31, 2018, the Company: (i) implemented enhancements to company-wide risk assessment processes; (ii) implemented monitoring\\ncontrols over IT implementations and other significant process changes and the related impact on the Company’s risk assessment and\\ncontrol environment; (iii) added staff focused on internal control oversight and delivered training for staff responsible for internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting; (iv) enhanced the Company’s process and control documentation; (v) implemented new processes and\\ncontrols relative to the execution and oversight of inventory, accounts receivable, net sales and cost of goods sold; (vi) enhanced\\nprocesses and controls over account reconciliations and manual journal entries; (vii) implemented monitoring controls over employee\\naccountability and compliance for control design and operation; and (viii) implemented new processes and controls to ensure the\\ncompleteness and accuracy of information used in performing manual controls.\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019 and prior to the filing of the 2019 Form 10-K, the Company completed its testing of the newly-\\ndesigned controls. In light of the foregoing remediation activities and testing of controls, the Company’s management determined that\\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019.\\nFor further information, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “The Company previously identified a material weakness in its internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting, which has now been remediated. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial\\nreporting could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or\\ncash flows.”\\n(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (\"ICFR\"). Other than as described in section (b) above, there have\\nnot been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 that have\\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\\n69\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n98/245'}\n",

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the\\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\\ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect\\non the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections\\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ KPMG LLP\\nNew York, New York\\nMarch\\xa012, 2020\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n116/245'}\n",

The Company grants credit terms in the normal\\ncourse of business to its customers. Trade credit is extended based upon periodically updated evaluations of each customer\\'s ability to\\nperform its payment obligations. The Company does not normally require collateral or other security to support credit sales. The\\nCompany\\'s three largest customers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 33% and 30% of the Company\\'s outstanding trade\\nreceivables at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\nInventories\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is based on standard cost and production variances, which\\napproximates actual cost on the first-in, first-out method. Cost components include direct materials, direct labor and direct overhead, as\\nwell as in-bound freight. The Company records adjustments to the value of its inventory based upon its forecasted plans to sell products\\nincluded in inventory, as well as planned product discontinuances. The physical condition (e.g., age and quality) of the inventories is\\nalso considered in establishing its valuation. These adjustments are estimates, which could vary significantly, either favorably or\\nunfavorably, from the amounts that the Company may ultimately realize upon the disposition of inventories if future economic\\nconditions, customer inventory levels, product discontinuances, sales return levels or competitive conditions differ from the Company\\'s\\nestimates and expectations.\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Other Assets\\nProperty, plant and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of such\\nassets as follows: land improvements, 20 to 30 years; buildings and improvements, 5 to 50 years; machinery and equipment, 3 to 15\\nyears; counters and trade fixtures, 3 to 5 years; office furniture and fixtures, 3 to 15 years; and capitalized software, 2 to 10 years.\\nLeasehold improvements and building improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives or over the terms of the leases or\\nremaining life of the original structure, whichever is shorter. Repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of operations as\\nincurred, and expenditures for additions and improvements are capitalized. Counters and trade fixtures are amortized over their\\nestimated useful life of the in-store counter and display related assets. The estimated useful life may be subject to change based upon\\ndeclines in net sales and/or changes in merchandising programs.

In the event of product discontinuances, from time-to-\\ntime, the Company may accelerate the amortization of related permanent wall displays based on the estimated remaining useful life of\\nthe asset. Amortization expense for permanent wall displays was $55.6\\xa0million and $50.7\\xa0million for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If events or changes in\\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company estimates the undiscounted future\\ncash flows (excluding interest) resulting from the use of the asset and its ultimate disposition. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows\\n(excluding interest) is less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes an impairment loss, measured as the amount by which the\\ncarrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. There were no impairment charges to long-lived assets during the years ended\\nDecember 31, 2019 and 2018.\\nDeferred Financing Costs\\nThe Company capitalizes deferred financing costs related to the issuance of revolving lines of credit and amortizes such costs over\\nthe terms of the related debt instruments using the effective-interest method. Capitalized deferred financing costs were nil and\\n$4.0\\xa0million during 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\nLeases\\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842)\" (\"ASU No. 2016-02\" or \"ASC\\n842\"), beginning as of January 1, 2019, using a modified retrospective approach and applying the standard’s transition provisions at the\\neffective date of January 1, 2019. ASU No. 2016-02 requires that a lessee recognize, for both finance leases and operating leases, a\\nliability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a Right-of-Use (“ROU”) asset representing its right to use the underlying\\nleased asset for the lease term. The lease liability is equal to the present value of the lease payments and the ROU asset is based on the\\nlease liability, subject to certain adjustments, such as pre-payments, initial direct costs, lease incentives and accrued rent. In addition,\\nupon adoption the Company elected the available practical expedients allowed by the guidance under:\\n•\\nASC 842-10-15-37, by not separating lease components from non-lease components and instead accounting for all\\ncomponents as a single lease component for all of its classes of underlying assets, i.e., for any type of equipment leases and\\nreal estate leases; and\\n•\\nASC 842-10-65-1, by not reassessing at the transition date: (i) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases;\\n(ii) lease classification for any expired or existing leases; and (iii) initial direct costs for any existing leases.\\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception, considering whether the contract conveys a right to control the\\nuse of the identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Operating leases are included in ROU assets, recorded\\nwithin “Property, Plant and Equipment,” and operating lease liabilities are recorded within either \"Accrued expenses and other current\\nliabilities\" and/or \"Other long-term liabilities\" in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in ROU\\nassets recorded within “Property, Plant and Equipment,” and finance lease liabilities are recorded within either \"Accrued expenses and\\nother current liabilities\" and/or \"Other long-term liabilities\" in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, given their immateriality.\\nAs most of the Company’s leases do not provide the lease implicit rates, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rates as the\\ndiscount rate, adjusted as applicable, based on the information available at the lease commencement dates to determine the present\\nvalue of lease payments. The Company may use the lease implicit rate, when readily determinable, as the discount rate to determine the\\npresent value of lease payments.\\nLease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that\\noption. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term.\\nAt lease commencement, for initial measurement, variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate, if any, are\\nexcluded from lease payments. Subsequent to initial measurement, these variable payments are recognized when the event determining\\nthe amount of the variable consideration to be paid occurs. Leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less are not included in the\\nlease liability or ROU asset.\\nF-15\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n139/245'}\n",

Goodwill is not\\namortized, but rather it is reviewed annually for impairment at the reporting unit level using October 1st carrying values, or when there\\nis evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the Company’s carrying amount may not be recovered.\\nFor 2019, in assessing whether goodwill was impaired in connection with its annual impairment testing performed during the\\nfourth quarter of 2019 using October 1st, 2019 carrying values, the Company, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards\\nBoard (\"FASB\"), Accounting Standard Codification (\"ASC\") 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\"ASC 350\"), performed\\nqualitative assessments for its (i) Revlon, (ii) Elizabeth Arden Skin and Color and (iii) Fragrances reporting units and a quantitative\\nassessment for its (x) Mass Portfolio, (y) Professional Portfolio and (z) Elizabeth Arden Fragrances reporting units.\\nIn performing the 2019 qualitative assessment, the Company considered, among other factors, the financial performance of each of\\nits Revlon, Elizabeth Arden Skin and Color and Fragrances reporting units, as well as the results of the annual quantitative analysis\\nperformed in 2018 for each of these reporting units. Based upon such assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than\\nnot that the fair value of each of its Revlon, Elizabeth Arden Skin and Color and Fragrances reporting units exceeded their respective\\ncarrying amounts for 2019.\\nIn performing the 2019 quantitative assessment, the Company used the simplified approach allowed under ASU No. 2017-04,\\n\"Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,\" which the Company early adopted in October 2018, to test its Mass Portfolio,\\nProfessional Portfolio and Elizabeth Arden Fragrances reporting units for impairment. Based upon such assessment, the Company\\ndetermined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its Mass Portfolio, Professional Portfolio and Elizabeth Arden\\nFragrances reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts for 2019.\\nFor 2018, the Company first performed a qualitative assessment on all of its reporting units, which indicated that indicators of\\nimpairment existed for the Mass Portfolio reporting unit within the Portfolio segment. Subsequently, the Company used the simplified\\napproach allowed under ASU No. 2017-04 to test its Mass Portfolio reporting unit for impairment. Following the results of such\\nassessment, the Company recognized an $18.0 million\\xa0non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the Mass Portfolio reporting\\nunit within the Portfolio segment in the fourth quarter of 2018. Following the recognition of this non-cash goodwill impairment charge,\\nthe Mass Portfolio reporting unit had\\xa0$54.3\\xa0million\\xa0in remaining goodwill as of December 31, 2018.\\nSee Note 7, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,\" for further information on the Company\\'s goodwill and annual impairment\\ntesting.\\nIntangible Assets, net\\nIntangible Assets, net, include trade names and trademarks, customer relationships, patents and internally developed intellectual\\nproperty (\"IP\") and acquired licenses.

See Note 7, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,\" for\\nfurther discussion of the Company\\'s intangible assets, including a summary of finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets.\\nRevenue Recognition and Sales Returns\\nOn January 1, 2018 the Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" using the modified\\nretrospective method. Results for the reporting period beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under this new guidance, while\\nprior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with the Company\\'s historical accounting practices under previous\\nguidance. However, given the nature of the Company\\'s products and the terms and conditions applicable to sales to its customers, the\\ntiming and amount of revenue recognized based on the underlying principles of this guidance are consistent with the Company\\'s\\nrevenue recognition policy under previous guidance.\\nIn accordance with the new guidance, the Company\\'s policy is to recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration\\nthat the Company expects that it will be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to its customers. The\\nCompany\\'s policy is to record revenue when control of the goods transfers to the customer. Net sales are comprised of gross revenues\\nfrom sales of products less expected product returns, trade discounts and customer allowances, which include costs associated with off-\\ninvoice mark-downs and other price reductions, as well as trade promotions and coupons.\\nThe Company allows customers to return their unsold products if and when they meet certain Company-established criteria as set\\nforth in the Company\\'s trade terms. The Company regularly reviews and revises, when deemed necessary, its estimates of sales returns\\nbased primarily upon the historical rate of actual product returns, planned product discontinuances, new product launches and estimates\\nof customer inventory and promotional sales. For returned products that the Company expects to resell at a profit, the Company\\nrecords, in addition to sales returns as a reduction to sales and cost of sales and an increase to accrued liabilities for the amount\\nexpected to be refunded to the customer, an increase to the asset account used to reflect the Company\\'s right to recover products. The\\namount of the asset account is valued based upon the former carrying amount of the product (i.e., inventory), less any expected costs to\\nrecover the products. As the estimated product returns that are expected to be resold at a profit do not comprise a significant amount of\\nthe Company\\'s net sales or assets, the Company does not separately report these amounts.\\nThe Company\\'s revenues are also net of certain marketing arrangements with its retail customers. Pursuant to its trade terms with\\nthese retail customers, the Company reimburses them for a portion of their advertising costs, which provide advertising benefits to the\\nCompany. These arrangements are in the form of marketing development funds and/or cooperative advertising programs and are used\\nby the Company to drive sales. The advertising programs follow an annual schedule of planned events that is continually updated based\\non the Company\\'s perceived needs and contractual terms. As these marketing expenditures cannot be directly linked to product sales,\\nthe Company records these expenses as a reduction of revenue at the higher of actual spend or estimated costs based on a reserve rate\\nmethodology. In limited instances when products are sold under consignment arrangements, the Company does not recognize revenue\\nuntil control over such products has transferred to the end consumer. Other revenues, primarily royalties, do not comprise a material\\namount of the Company\\'s net sales.\\nThe Company incurs costs associated with product distribution, such as freight and handling costs. The Company has elected to\\ntreat these costs as fulfillment activities and recognizes these costs at the same time that it recognizes the underlying product revenue.\\nF-17\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n142/245'}\n",

For products manufactured in the Company\\'s own\\nfacilities, such costs include raw materials and supplies, direct labor and factory overhead. For products manufactured for the Company\\nby third-party contractors, such cost represents the amounts invoiced by the contractors. Cost of sales also includes the cost of\\nrefurbishing products returned by customers that will be offered for resale and the cost of inventory write-downs associated with\\nadjustments of held inventories to their net realizable value. These costs are reflected in the Company’s consolidated statements of\\noperations and comprehensive (loss) income when the product is sold and net sales revenues are recognized or, in the case of inventory\\nwrite-downs, when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of inventories is in excess of their recoverable value. Additionally,\\ncost of sales reflects the costs associated with certain free products included as sales and promotional incentives. These incentive costs\\nare recognized at the same time that the Company recognizes the related revenue.\\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses include expenses to advertise the Company\\'s products, such as television\\nadvertising production costs and air-time costs, print advertising costs, digital marketing costs, promotional displays and consumer\\npromotions. SG&A expenses also include the amortization of permanent wall displays and finite-lived intangible assets, depreciation of\\ncertain fixed assets, distribution costs (such as freight and handling), non-manufacturing overhead (principally personnel and related\\nexpenses), selling and trade educations fees, insurance and professional service fees.\\nAdvertising\\nAdvertising within SG&A expenses includes television, print, digital marketing and other advertising production costs that are\\nexpensed the first time the advertising takes place. The costs of promotional displays are expensed in the period in which they are\\nshipped to customers. Advertising expenses were $446.8\\xa0 million and\\xa0 $507.0\\xa0 million\\xa0 for\\xa0 2019 and\\xa0 2018, respectively, which were\\nincluded in SG&A expenses in the Company\\'s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. The Company\\nalso has various arrangements with customers pursuant to its trade terms to reimburse them for a portion of their advertising costs,\\nwhich provide advertising benefits to the Company. Additionally, from time-to-time, the Company may pay fees to customers in order\\nto expand or maintain shelf space for its products. The costs that the Company incurs for \"cooperative\" advertising programs, end cap\\nplacement, shelf placement costs, slotting fees and marketing development funds, if any, are expensed as incurred and are recorded as a\\nreduction within net sales.\\nDistribution Costs\\nCosts associated with product distribution, such as freight and handling costs, are recorded within SG&A expenses when incurred.\\nDistribution costs were\\xa0$135.7\\xa0million and $144.6\\xa0million for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\nIncome Taxes\\nIncome taxes are calculated using the asset and liability method. Under this method, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets\\nand liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of\\nassets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures\\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary\\ndifferences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company recognizes the effect of a change in income tax rates on deferred tax\\nassets and liabilities in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records valuation allowances to reduce\\ndeferred tax assets when management determines that it was more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The Company\\nrecognizes a tax position in its financial statements when management determines that it was more likely than not that the position will\\nbe sustained upon examination, based on the merits of such position. The Company recognizes liabilities for unrecognized tax positions\\nin the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due. If payment\\nof these amounts is ultimately not required, the reversal of the liabilities would result in additional tax benefits recognized in the period\\nin which the Company determines that the liabilities are no longer required. If the estimate of tax liabilities is ultimately less than the\\nfinal assessment, this will result in a further charge to expense. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax\\nmatters in income tax expense.

Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the results of\\noperations. Gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and branches operating in non-\\nhyperinflationary economies are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss until either the sale or upon the\\ncomplete or substantially complete liquidation by the Company of its investment in a foreign entity. To the extent that foreign\\nsubsidiaries and branches operate in hyperinflationary economies, non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical rates\\nand translation adjustments are included in the Company\\'s results of operations.\\nBasic and Diluted Earnings per Common Share and Classes of Stock\\nShares used in basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during\\neach period. Shares used in diluted earnings per share include the dilutive effect of unvested restricted shares and restricted stock units\\n(\"RSUs\") issued under the Stock Plan using the treasury stock method. (See Note 18, \"Revlon, Inc. Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss)\\nPer Common Share\").\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nThe Company recognizes stock-based compensation costs for its restricted stock and restricted stock units, measured at the fair\\nvalue of each award at the time of grant, as an expense over the period during which an employee is required to provide service. Upon\\nthe vesting of restricted stock and RSUs, any resulting tax benefits are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and\\ncomprehensive (loss) income as the awards vest or are settled. The Company reflects such excess tax benefits as cash flows from\\nfinancing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company accounts for forfeitures as a reduction of compensation\\ncost in the period when such forfeitures occur.\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nThe Company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations. The Company may, from time-to-time, use\\nderivative financial instruments, including: (i) foreign currency forward exchange contracts (\"FX Contracts\") intended for the purpose\\nof managing foreign currency exchange risk by reducing the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the\\nCompany’s net cash flows; and (ii) interest rate hedging transactions intended for the purpose of managing interest rate risk associated\\nwith Products Corporation’s variable rate indebtedness.\\nForeign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts\\nProducts Corporation may, from time-to-time, enter into FX Contracts primarily to hedge the anticipated net cash flows resulting\\nfrom inventory purchases and intercompany payments denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of the Company’s\\nforeign and domestic operations and generally have maturities of less than one year. The Company does not apply hedge accounting to\\nits FX Contracts. The Company records FX Contracts in its consolidated balance sheet at fair value and immediately recognizes\\nchanges in fair value in earnings. Fair value of the Company’s FX Contracts is determined by using observable market transactions of\\nspot and forward rates. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no outstanding FX Contracts.

(\"Elizabeth Arden,\" the \"Elizabeth Arden Acquisition\" and the \"Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date,\" respectively), the\\ncritical terms of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap (as hereinafter defined) no longer matched the terms of the underlying debt and the 2013\\nInterest Rate Swap was determined to no longer be highly effective. Accordingly, the Company discontinued hedge accounting for the\\n2013 Interest Rate Swap during the third quarter of 2016. Following this de-designation, changes in the fair value of the 2013 Interest\\nRate Swap were accounted for as a component of other non-operating expenses. Accumulated deferred losses of $6.3\\xa0 million, or\\n$3.9\\xa0million net of tax, at the De-designation Date, that were previously recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive\\nloss, were fully amortized into earnings over the remaining term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap, which expired in May 2018.

Refer to Note 9, \"Debt,\" for further\\ndetails related to financing the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition and related debt restructuring transactions.\\nRecent Transactions\\nIn connection with the Company\\'s ongoing Strategic Review, during 2019 the divestiture from certain brands resulted in gains on\\nsale of assets of approximately $27.4\\xa0million, which are recorded in \"(Gain) loss on divested assets\" on the Company\\'s Consolidated\\nStatement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as of December 31, 2019.\\nSee Note 22, “Subsequent Events” for more recent transactions.\\nRecently Evaluated and/ or Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, which requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a related lease\\nliability on the balance sheet for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases. The lease liability will be equal to the present value\\nof lease payments and the right-of-use asset will be based on the lease liability, subject to certain adjustments, such as initial direct\\ncosts. Leases will continue to be classified as either operating or finance leases in the income statement. This guidance is effective for\\nannual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.

Further, the new credit loss model will affect how entities in all\\nindustries estimate their allowance for losses for receivables that are current with respect to their payment terms. ASU No. 2018-19\\nfurther clarifies that receivables arising from operating leases are not within the scope of Topic 326. Instead, impairment from\\nreceivables of operating leases should be accounted for in accordance with Topic 842, Leases.

The Company utilized\\nthe two-step process in assessing whether goodwill was impaired for each of the Company's six reporting units and determined that it\\nwas more likely than not that the fair values of each of these reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts.\\nIntangible Assets, Net\\nThe following tables present details of the Company's total intangible assets as of December\\xa031, 2019 and December\\xa031, 2018:\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n160/245\"}\n",

The 2016 Revolving Credit\\nAgreement provided that the “Liquidity Amount” (defined in the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement as the sum of each\\nborrowing base less the sum of (x) the aggregate outstanding extensions of credit under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility,\\nand (y) any availability reserve in effect on such date) may exceed the aggregate commitments under the Amended 2016 Revolving\\nCredit Facility by up to 5%. Amendment No. 2 limits the Liquidity Amount to no more than the aggregate commitments under the\\nAmended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. Under the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement, a “Liquidity Event Period” generally occurred\\nif Products Corporation’s Liquidity Amount fell below the greater of $35\\xa0million and 10% of the maximum availability under the 2016\\nRevolving Credit Facility. Amendment No. 2 changed these thresholds to $50\\xa0million and 15%, respectively, only for purposes of\\ntriggering certain notification obligations of Products Corporation, increased borrowing base reporting frequency and the ability of the\\nadministrative agent to apply amounts collected in controlled accounts for the repayment of loans under the Amended 2016 Revolving\\nCredit Facility. After entering into Amendment No. 2, in March 2019 Products Corporation’s availability under the Amended 2016\\nRevolving Credit Facility was $37.3\\xa0million, which was less than the greater of $35\\xa0million and 10% of the maximum availability\\nunder the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, which at such date equated to $41.3\\xa0million. Accordingly, effective beginning in\\nMarch 2019 Products Corporation is required to maintain a FCCR of a minimum of 1.0 to 1.0 (which it currently satisfies), the\\nadministrative agent may apply amounts collected in controlled accounts for the repayment of loans under the Amended 2016\\nRevolving Credit Facility, which the administrative agent began applying in March 2019, and Products Corporation is required to\\nprovide the administrative agent with weekly borrowing base certificates. Products Corporation will be required to: (i) maintain such\\n1.0 to 1.0 minimum FCCR until such time that availability under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility equals or exceeds the\\ngreater of $35\\xa0million and 10% of the maximum availability under such facility for at least 20 consecutive business days; and (ii)\\nProducts Corporation will continue to provide the administrative agent with weekly borrowing base certificates and the administrative\\nagent may continue to apply amounts collected in controlled accounts as set forth above in each case until such time that availability\\nunder such facility is equal or exceeds the greater of $50\\xa0million and 15% of the maximum availability under such facility for at least\\n20 consecutive business days.

The 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility has an uncommitted incremental facility pursuant to which it may be increased\\nfrom time to time by up to €43 million, subject to certain conditions and the agreement of the lenders providing such increase.

The borrowing base calculation in\\nrespect of the Tranche A under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility is based on the sum of: (i) 85% of eligible accounts\\nreceivable; (ii) the lesser of 85% of the net orderly liquidation value and a percentage of the value specified in respect of different types\\nof eligible inventory; (iii) the lesser of (A) the sum of (x) 75% of the net orderly liquidation value in respect of eligible equipment and\\n(y) 75% of the mortgage value of eligible real property and (B) $40\\xa0million; and (iv) qualified restricted cash (capped at $75\\xa0million),\\nwhich are collectively subject to certain availability reserves set by the administrative agent. The borrowing base calculation in respect\\nof the Tranche B under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility is based on the sum of: (i) 10% of eligible accounts receivable and\\n(ii) the lesser of 10% of the net orderly liquidation value and a percentage of the value specified in respect of different types of eligible\\ninventory, which are collectively subject to certain availability reserves set by the administrative agent. Tranche A under the Amended\\n2016 Revolving Credit Facility matures on the earlier of: (x) September 7, 2021; and (y) the 91st day prior to the maturity of Products\\nCorporation’s 5.75% Senior Notes due February 15, 2021 if, on that date (and solely for so long as), (i) any of Products Corporation’s\\n5.75% Senior Notes remain outstanding and (ii) Products Corporation’s available liquidity does not exceed the aggregate principal\\namount of its then outstanding 5.75% Senior Notes by at least $200\\xa0million. Tranche B under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit\\nFacility matures on April 17, 2020.\\nGuarantees and Security: The Restricted Group under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement (which is the same as the\\nRestricted Group under the 2016 Term Loan Agreement) is subject to the covenants under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit\\nAgreement. The Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by each of Products Corporation's existing and future direct or\\nindirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries (subject to various exceptions), certain foreign subsidiaries, as well as by\\nRevlon on a limited recourse basis. The obligations of Revlon, Products Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors under the Amended\\n2016 Revolving Credit Facility are secured by pledges of the equity of Products Corporation held by Revlon and the equity of Products\\nCorporation’s restricted subsidiaries held by Products Corporation and each subsidiary guarantor (subject to certain exceptions,\\nincluding equity of first-tier foreign subsidiaries in excess of 65% of the voting equity interests of such entity) and by substantially all\\ntangible and intangible personal and real property of Products Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors (subject to certain exclusions).\\nThe obligors and guarantors under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2016 Term Loan Facility are identical. The\\nliens on the Revolving Facility Collateral securing the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility rank first in priority to the liens\\nthereon securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which rank second in priority on such collateral. The liens on the Term Loan Collateral\\nsecuring the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility rank second in priority to the liens thereon securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility,\\nwhich rank first in priority on such collateral.\\nInterest and Fees: Under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, interest is payable quarterly and accrues on borrowings\\nunder such facility at a rate per annum equal to either: (i) the alternate base rate plus an applicable margin equal to (A) in the case of the\\nTranche A, 0.25%, 0.50% or 0.75%, or (B) in the case of the Tranche B, 1.50%, 1.75% or 2.00%, in each case depending on the\\naverage excess availability (based on the borrowing base as most recently reported by Products Corporation to the administrative agent\\nfrom time-to-time); or (ii) the Eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin equal to (A) in the case of the Tranche A, 1.25%, 1.50% or\\n1.75%, or (B) in the case of the Tranche B, 2.50%, 2.75% or 3.00%, in each case depending on the average excess availability (based\\non the borrowing base as most recently reported by Products Corporation to the administrative agent from time-to-time), at Products\\nCorporation’s option. The applicable margin decreases as the average excess availability under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit\\nFacility increases.\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n173/245\"}\n",

The Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement contains certain customary\\nrepresentations, warranties and events of default. If Products Corporation’s \"Liquidity Amount\" (defined in the Amended 2016\\nRevolving Credit Agreement as the Borrowing Base (capped at 100% of the Revolving Commitment) less the sum of (x) the aggregate\\noutstanding extensions of credit under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, and (y) any availability reserve in effect on such\\ndate falls below the greater of $35\\xa0million and 10% of the maximum availability under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility (a\\n\"Liquidity Event Period\"), then the Restricted Group will be required to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (the ratio\\nof Products Corporation’s EBITDA minus capital expenditures to cash interest expense and scheduled principal payments under the\\n2016 Term Loan Agreement for such period, the \"FCCR\") of a minimum of 1.0 to 1.0 until the first date after 20 consecutive business\\ndays for which the Liquidity Amount is equal to or greater than such threshold. Under Amendment No. 2, such availability reserve\\namounts were set at $50\\xa0 million and 15% in connection with triggering certain notification obligations, increased borrowing base\\nreporting frequency, and the ability of the administrative agent to apply amounts collected in controlled accounts for the repayment of\\nloans under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. If Products Corporation is in default under the consolidated fixed charge\\ncoverage ratio under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement, Products Corporation may cure such default by Products\\nCorporation and/or Revlon issuing certain equity securities and Products Corporation receiving capital contributions from Revlon, with\\nsuch cash being deemed to increase EBITDA for the purpose of calculating the applicable ratio. Products Corporation may exercise this\\ncure right no more than two times in any four-quarter period, and no more than five times in total during the term of the Amended 2016\\nRevolving Credit Facility. As Products Corporation’s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio was greater than 1.0 to 1.0 as of\\nDecember 31, 2019, all of the $157.7\\xa0million of availability under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility was available as of\\nsuch date.\\nPrepayments: Products Corporation must prepay (i) Tranche A borrowings under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility to\\nthe extent that outstanding loans thereunder and letters of credit exceed the Tranche A availability and (ii) Tranche B borrowings under\\nthe Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility to the extent that outstanding loans thereunder exceed the Tranche B availability;\\nprovided that the Tranche A borrowings are required to be repaid prior to the repayment of the Tranche B borrowings. During a\\nLiquidity Event Period, the administrative agent may apply amounts collected in controlled accounts for the repayment of loans under\\nthe Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. After entering into Amendment No. 2, in March 2019 Products Corporation’s availability\\nunder the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility was $37.3\\xa0million, which was less than the greater of $35\\xa0million and 10% of the\\nmaximum availability under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, which at such date equated to $41.3\\xa0million. Accordingly,\\neffective beginning in March 2019 Products Corporation is required to maintain a FCCR of a minimum of 1.0 to 1.0 (which it currently\\nsatisfies), the administrative agent may apply amounts collected in controlled accounts for the repayment of loans under the Amended\\n2016 Revolving Credit Facility, which the administrative agent began applying in March 2019, and Products Corporation is required to\\nprovide the administrative agent with weekly borrowing base certificates. Products Corporation will be required to: (i) maintain such\\n1.0 to 1.0 minimum FCCR until such time that availability under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility equals or exceeds the\\ngreater of $35\\xa0million and 10% of the maximum availability under such facility for at least 20 consecutive business days; and (ii)\\nProducts Corporation will continue to provide the administrative agent with weekly borrowing base certificates and the administrative\\nagent may continue to apply amounts collected in controlled accounts as set forth above in each case until such time that availability\\nunder such facility is equal or exceeds the greater of $50\\xa0million and 15% of the maximum availability under such facility for at least\\n20 consecutive business days.

The\\nCompany does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\\nForeign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts\\nThe FX Contracts may, from time to time, be entered into primarily to hedge the anticipated net cash flows resulting from\\ninventory purchases and intercompany payments denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of the Company’s foreign\\nand domestic operations and generally have maturities of less than one year. The Company did not enter into any FX Contracts during\\n2019. The U.S. Dollar notional amounts of the FX Contracts outstanding at each of December\\xa031, 2019 and December\\xa031, 2018 were\\nnil.\\nInterest Rate Swap Transaction\\nIn November 2013, Products Corporation executed a forward-starting floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction (the \"2013\\nInterest Rate Swap\") that, at its inception, was based on a notional amount of $400 million in respect of indebtedness under Products\\nCorporation’s 2013 bank term loan that was incurred in connection with completing the October 2013 acquisition of The Colomer\\nGroup (the \"Old Acquisition Term Loan\" and the \"Colomer Acquisition,\" respectively). The 2013 Interest Rate Swap, which initially\\nhad a floor of 1.00% that in December 2016 was amended to 0.75%, expired in May 2018. In connection with entering into the 2016\\nTerm Loan Facility, the 2013 Interest Rate Swap was carried over to apply to a notional amount of $400 million in respect of\\nindebtedness under such loan for the remaining balance of the term of such swap. The Company initially designated the 2013 Interest\\nRate Swap as a cash flow hedge of the variability of the forecasted 3-month LIBOR interest rate payments initially related to the $400\\nmillion notional amount under the Old Acquisition Term Loan over the 3-year term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap (and subsequently\\nto the $400 million notional amount under the 2016 Term Loan Facility). Under the terms of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap, Products\\nCorporation received from the counterparty a floating interest rate based on the higher of the 3-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR or the floor\\npercentage in effect, while paying a fixed interest rate payment to the counterparty equal to 2.0709% (which, with respect to the 2016\\nTerm Loan Facility, effectively fixed the interest rate on such notional amount at 5.5709% through May 2018).\\nAs a result of completely refinancing the Old Acquisition Term Loan with a portion of the proceeds from Product\\'s Corporation\\'s\\nconsummation of the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities and the issuance of its 6.25% Senior Notes in connection with consummating the\\nElizabeth Arden Acquisition, the critical terms of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap no longer matched the terms of the underlying debt\\nunder the 2016 Term Loan Facility. At the refinancing date, which was the same as the September 7, 2016 Elizabeth Arden Acquisition\\nDate (the \"De-designation Date\"), the 2013 Interest Rate Swap was determined to no longer be highly effective and the Company\\ndiscontinued hedge accounting for the 2013 Interest Rate Swap. Following the de-designation of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap, changes\\nin fair value of such swap were accounted for as a component of other non-operating expenses. Accumulated deferred losses of $6.3\\nmillion, or $3.9 million net of tax, at the De-designation Date, that were previously recorded as a component of accumulated other\\ncomprehensive loss, were fully amortized into earnings over the remaining term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap, which expired in May\\n2018. See \"Quantitative Information – Derivative Financial Instruments\" below for additional information on the balance sheet\\nbalances related to this swap.\\nCredit Risk\\nExposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties to the Company\\'s derivative instruments is\\nlimited to the gross fair value of these derivative instruments in asset positions, which was nil at each of December\\xa031, 2019 and\\nDecember\\xa031, 2018. The Company attempts to minimize exposure to credit risk by generally entering into derivative contracts with\\ncounterparties that have investment-grade credit ratings and are major financial institutions.

Under the\\n\"full yield curve\" method, the discount rate assumption was built through the application of specific spot rates along the yield curve\\nused in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows for each of the Company\\'s pension and other\\npost-retirement plans. Prior to December 31, 2015, the Company estimated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single\\nweighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the\\nperiod. The change did not affect the measurement of the Company\\'s total projected benefit obligations, as the change in service and\\ninterest costs was exactly offset in the actuarial loss (gain) recognized for each year. The Company made this change to provide a more\\nprecise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the\\ncorresponding spot yield curve rates. The change to the \"full yield curve\" method was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate\\nthat was inseparable from a change in accounting principle, and accordingly, was accounted for prospectively.\\nIn selecting its expected long-term rate of return on its pension plan assets, the Company considers a number of factors, including,\\nwithout limitation, recent and historical performance of pension plan assets, the pension plan portfolios\\' asset allocations over a variety\\nof time periods compared with third-party studies, the performance of the capital markets in recent years and other factors, as well as\\nadvice from various third parties, such as the pension plans\\' advisors, investment managers and actuaries. While the Company\\nconsidered both the recent performance and the historical performance of pension plan assets, the Company’s assumptions are based\\nprimarily on its estimates of long-term, prospective rates of return. Using the aforementioned methodologies, the Company selected a\\n6.00% and 4.86% weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption during 2019 for the U.S. and International\\npension plans, respectively. Differences between actual and expected asset returns are recognized in the net periodic benefit cost over\\nthe remaining service period of the active participating employees.\\nThe rate of future compensation increases is an assumption used by the actuarial consultants for pension accounting and is\\ndetermined based on the Company’s current expectation for such increases.\\nInvestment Policy:\\nThe Investment Committee for the Company\\'s U.S. pension plans (the \"Investment Committee\") has adopted (and revises from\\ntime-to-time) an investment policy for the Company\\'s U.S. pension plans with the objective of realizing a long-term rate of return on\\npension plan assets that meets or exceeds, over time, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, weighed against a\\nreasonable risk level. In connection with this objective, the Investment Committee retains a professional investment advisor who\\nrecommends investment managers that invest plan assets in the following asset classes: common and preferred stock, mutual funds,\\nfixed income securities, common and collective funds, hedge funds, group annuity contracts and cash and other investments. The\\nCompany’s International plans follow a similar methodology in conjunction with local actuarial consultants and asset managers.\\nThe investment policy adopted by the Investment Committee provides for investments in a broad range of publicly-traded\\nsecurities, among other things. The investments are in domestic and international stocks, ranging from small to large capitalization\\nstocks, debt securities ranging from domestic and international treasury issues, corporate debt securities, mortgages and asset-backed\\nissues. Other investments may include cash and cash equivalents and hedge funds. The investment policy also allows for investments in\\nprivate equity funds that are not covered in investments described above, provided that the Investment Committee approves any such\\ninvestments prior to their selection. Also, global balanced strategies are utilized to provide for investments in a broad range of publicly-\\ntraded stocks and bonds in both domestic and international markets, as described above. In addition, the global balanced strategies can\\ninclude commodities, provided that the Investment Committee approves any such investments prior to their selection.\\nThe Investment Committee’s investment policy does not allow the use of derivatives for speculative purposes, but such policy does\\nallow its investment managers to use derivatives for the purpose of reducing risk exposures or to replicate exposures of a particular\\nasset class.\\nThe Company’s U.S. and International pension plans have target asset allocation ranges that are intended to be flexible guidelines\\nfor allocating the plans’ assets among various classes of assets. These target ranges are reviewed periodically and considered for\\nreadjustment when an asset class weighting is outside of its target range (recognizing that these are flexible target ranges that may vary\\nfrom time-to-time) with the objective of meeting or exceeding the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, weighed\\nagainst a reasonable risk level. The target ranges per asset class in effect for 2019 were as follows:\\xa0\\nF-51\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n193/245'}\n",

The Plan classifies\\ncommon and preferred stock investments within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\\n•\\nMutual funds: The fair values of the investments included in the mutual funds asset class are determined using net asset value\\n(“NAV”) provided by the administrator of the funds. The NAV is based on the closing price reported on the major market\\nwhere the individual securities within the mutual fund are traded. The Company classifies mutual fund investments within\\nLevel 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\\n•\\nFixed income securities: The fair values of the investments included in the fixed income securities asset class are based on a\\ncompilation of primarily observable market information and/or broker quotes. The Company classifies fixed income securities\\ninvestments within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\\n•\\nCommon and collective funds: The fair values of the investments included in the common and collective funds asset class are\\ndetermined using NAV provided by the administrator of the funds. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets\\nowned by the common and collective fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. The\\nredemption frequencies for the investments in the common and collective funds asset class range from daily to monthly, with\\nredemption notice periods that range from 2 to 10 business days. The Company classifies common and collective fund\\ninvestments within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, depending on whether certain criteria are met. Some\\ncommon and collective funds for which fair value is not readily determinable are recorded using NAV per share or its\\nequivalent, as permitted by the practical expedient, provided by ASU No. 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820):\\nDisclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset per Share (or Its Equivalent) (the “ASU No. 2015-07\\npractical expedient”). These investments are not assigned a fair value hierarchy level.\\n•\\nHedge funds: The hedge funds asset class includes hedge funds that primarily invest in a grouping of equities, fixed income\\ninstruments, currencies, derivatives and/or commodities. The fair values of investments included in the hedge funds class are\\ndetermined using NAV provided by the administrator of the funds. The hedge fund investments in the hedge funds asset class\\nmay employ leverage, generally can be sold on a quarterly or monthly basis and have redemption notice periods that range up\\nto 90 business days. Hedge fund investments are generally recorded using NAV per share or its equivalent, as permitted by the\\nASU No. 2015-07 practical expedient, and are not assigned a fair value hierarchy level.\\n•\\nCash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents are measured at cost, which approximates fair value.

In July 2014, the Stock Plan was amended to renew the Stock Plan for a 7-year renewal term expiring on April 14,\\n2021. In September 2019 the Stock Plan was amended in connection with the 2019 TIP, described below, to: (1) allow the\\nCompensation Committee to delegate to Revlon’s Chief Executive Officer the authority to grant RSUs to the Company’s employees,\\nother than its officers who are subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (i.e., the Company’s Chief\\nExecutive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer & Controller); (2) allow for accelerated vesting of equity\\nawards upon a termination without cause; (3) change the minimum vesting period for specified equity awards from 3 years to 2 years;\\nand (4) to increase by 250,000 shares the number of shares of Revlon common stock that are not subject to the Stock Plan’s minimum\\nvesting requirements.\\nStock options:\\nNon-qualified stock options granted under the Stock Plan, if granted, are granted at prices that equal or exceed the fair market\\nvalue of Class A Common Stock on the grant date and have a term of 7 years. Option grants generally vest over service periods that\\nrange from 1 year to 4 years.\\nAt December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, there were no options exercisable under the Stock Plan and there was no stock option activity for\\n2019 and 2018.\\nF-55\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n200/245'}\n",

For any deferred tax asset\\nin excess of the amount for which it is more likely than not that the Company will realize a benefit, the Company establishes a\\nvaluation allowance. A valuation allowance is a non-cash charge, and it in no way limits the Company's ability to utilize its deferred tax\\nassets, including its ability to utilize tax loss and credit carryforward amounts. As of 2019, the Company concluded that, based on the\\nweight of the available positive and negative evidence, it does not require a valuation allowance on its federal deferred tax assets, other\\nthan those associated with the limitation on the deductibility of interest. The Company does have a valuation allowance on deferred tax\\nassets associated with its activity in certain U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions. These conclusions regarding the establishment of\\nvaluation allowances on the Company's deferred tax assets as of the end of 2019 are consistent with the Company's conclusions on such\\nmatters as of the end of 2018. However, if the Company does not generate sufficient taxable income in future periods, its deferred tax\\nassets may not be realizable on a more-likely-than-not basis. In such event, the Company may be required to establish an additional\\nvaluation allowance against its deferred tax assets in future periods, which would materially increase the Company's tax expense in the\\nperiod in which the allowance is recognized and would adversely impact the Company's results of operations and statement of financial\\ncondition in such period. The Company will continue to monitor the circumstances that would require it to establish an additional\\nvaluation allowance on its deferred tax assets. Accordingly, depending on future evidence that may become available, the Company's\\nassessments regarding its valuation allowance position may change.\\nA valuation allowance has been provided for those deferred tax assets for which, in the opinion of the Company's management, it\\nwas more likely than not that a benefit will not be realized. At December\\xa031, 2019, the deferred tax valuation allowance primarily\\nrepresented amounts for foreign jurisdictions where, as of the end of 2019, the Company had a three-year cumulative loss, and for\\ncertain U.S. state jurisdictions where the Company had tax loss carryforwards and other tax attributes which may expire prior to being\\nutilized. The deferred tax valuation allowance decreased by $2.4\\xa0 million and increased by $75.0\\xa0 million during 2019 and 2018,\\nrespectively. The decrease in the deferred tax valuation allowance during 2019 was primarily associated with the write-off of valuation\\nallowances on deferred tax assets no longer available and a release in foreign valuation allowance no longer required, offset by\\nvaluation allowances required on interest deduction limitations and foreign and state tax loss carryforwards for which the Company has\\ndetermined it is more likely than not that it will not receive a benefit. The increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance during 2018\\nwas primarily associated with the interest deduction limitation and foreign and state tax loss carryforwards for which the Company has\\ndetermined it is more likely than not that it will not receive a benefit.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2019, the Company had domestic (federal) and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $939.7\\xa0million, of\\nwhich $310.6\\xa0 million are foreign and $629.1\\xa0 million are domestic (federal). These losses expire in future years as follows: 2020-\\n$4.5\\xa0million; 2021- $2.8\\xa0million; 2022 and beyond- $615.4\\xa0million; and unlimited- $317.0\\xa0million. The Company also has certain state\\nnet operating loss carryforwards that expire between 2020 and 2038. The Company could receive the benefit of such tax loss\\ncarryforwards only to the extent it has taxable income during the carryforward periods in the applicable tax jurisdictions. As of\\nDecember\\xa0 31, 2019, there were no consolidated federal net operating losses available from the MacAndrews & Forbes Group (as\\nhereinafter defined) from periods prior to the March 25, 2004 deconsolidation (as described below). The Company has acquired entities\\nthat had carryforward balances for tax losses, tax credits and other tax attributes at the time of the acquisition. U.S. federal and certain\\nstate and foreign jurisdictions impose limitations on the amount of these tax losses, tax credits and other carryforward balances that\\nmay be utilized after an acquisition. The Company has evaluated the impact of these limitations and has established a valuation\\nallowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that the Company expects will be realized.\\nThe Company remains subject to examination of its income tax returns in various jurisdictions, including: Spain for the tax years\\nended December 31, 2009 and forward; the U.S. (federal) for the tax years ended June 30, 2016 and forward; Canada for the tax years\\nended December 31, 2012 and forward; Australia for the tax years ended December 31, 2015 and forward; Switzerland for the tax years\\nended June 30, 2014 and forward; Japan for the tax years ended December 31, 2013 and forward; and the U.K. for the tax years ended\\nDecember 31, 2016 and forward.\\nAt December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $78.0\\xa0million and $74.7\\xa0million, respectively,\\nincluding $11.7\\xa0million and $9.8\\xa0million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties. Of the $78.0\\xa0million of unrecognized tax\\nbenefits as of December\\xa0 31, 2019, $46.1\\xa0 million would affect the Company's effective tax rate, if recognized, and the remaining\\n$31.9\\xa0million would affect the Company's deferred tax accounts. The Company classifies interest and penalties as a component of the\\nprovision for income taxes.

Revlon Holdings (as hereinafter defined in Note 20, \"Related Party Transactions - Transfer\\nAgreements\"), Revlon, Products Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries, and MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated entered into a tax\\nsharing agreement (as subsequently amended and restated, the \"MacAndrews & Forbes Tax Sharing Agreement\"), for taxable periods\\nbeginning on or after January 1, 1992 through and including March 25, 2004, during which Revlon and Products Corporation or a\\nsubsidiary of Products Corporation was a member of the MacAndrews & Forbes Group. In these taxable periods, Revlon\\'s and\\nProducts Corporation\\'s federal taxable income and loss were included in such group\\'s consolidated tax return filed by MacAndrews &\\nForbes Incorporated. During such period, Revlon and Products Corporation were also included in certain state and local tax returns of\\nMacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated or its subsidiaries. Revlon and Products Corporation remain liable under the MacAndrews &\\nForbes Tax Sharing Agreement for all such taxable periods through and including March 25, 2004 for amounts determined to be due as\\na result of a redetermination arising from an audit or otherwise, equal to the taxes that Revlon or Products Corporation would otherwise\\nhave had to pay if it were to have filed separate federal, state or local income tax returns for such periods.\\nMacAndrews & Forbes’ current ownership does not require the Company to file a U.S. federal consolidated tax return with them.\\nHowever, in certain U.S. states and in certain local and foreign jurisdictions the Company is required to file consolidated, combined,\\nunitary or similar returns. The liability for these state, local and foreign liabilities is also governed by the MacAndrews & Forbes Tax\\nSharing Agreement. The Company accounts for its tax liabilities in these jurisdictions as if it were a separate filer, and the Company\\'s\\ntax accounts are presented as if it were a separate filer. During 2019, the Company\\'s cash tax payments included $2.3\\xa0 million of\\npayments made to MacAndrews & Forbes in connection with these filings, and the Company\\'s ending tax asset, which is a component\\nof prepaid and other current assets, includes an insignificant amount related to future payments to be received from MacAndrews &\\nForbes in connection with these filings.\\nFollowing the closing of the 2004 Revlon Exchange Transactions, Revlon became the parent of a new consolidated group for\\nfederal income tax purposes and Products Corporation\\'s federal taxable income and loss are included in such group\\'s consolidated tax\\nreturns. Accordingly, Revlon and Products Corporation entered into a tax sharing agreement (the \"Revlon Tax Sharing Agreement\")\\npursuant to which Products Corporation is required to pay to Revlon amounts equal to the taxes that Products Corporation would\\notherwise have had to pay if Products Corporation were to file separate federal, state or local income tax returns, limited to the amount,\\nand payable only at such times, as Revlon will be required to make payments to the applicable taxing authorities.\\nF-62\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n211/245'}\n",

As a result of the similarities in the procurement, manufacturing and distribution processes for\\nthe Company’s products, much of the information provided in the Consolidated Financial Statements and provided in the segment table\\nbelow is similar to, or the same as, that reviewed on a regular basis by the Company\\'s Chief Executive Officer.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2019, the Company’s operations are organized into the following reportable segments:\\n•\\nRevlon - The Revlon segment is comprised of the Company\\'s flagship Revlon brands.

The Company allocates\\ncorporate expenses to each reportable segment to arrive at segment profit, and these expenses are included in the internal measure of\\nsegment operating performance. The Company defines segment profit as income from continuing operations before interest, taxes,\\ndepreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, gains/losses on foreign currency fluctuations, gains/losses on the early\\nextinguishment of debt and miscellaneous expenses. Segment profit also excludes the impact of certain items that are not directly\\nattributable to the reportable segments\\' underlying operating performance. Such items are shown below in the table reconciling segment\\nprofit to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes.

CONTINGENCIES\\nThe Company is involved in various routine legal proceedings incidental to the ordinary course of its business. The Company\\nbelieves that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on\\nthe Company’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. However, in light of the uncertainties\\ninvolved in legal proceedings generally, the ultimate outcome of a particular matter could be material to the Company’s operating\\nresults for a particular period depending on, among other things, the size of the loss or the nature of the liability imposed and the level\\nof the Company’s income for that particular period.\\n20. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2019, MacAndrews & Forbes beneficially owned approximately 87.1% of Revlon\\'s Class A Common Stock,\\nwhich at such date was Revlon\\'s only class of capital stock outstanding. As a result, MacAndrews & Forbes is able to elect Revlon’s\\nentire Board of Directors and control the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of Revlon\\'s stockholders. MacAndrews & Forbes is\\nbeneficially owned by Ronald O. Perelman.

(\"Revlon Holdings\"), and which is an\\naffiliate and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes, and certain of Revlon Holdings’ wholly-owned\\nsubsidiaries. Revlon and Products Corporation also entered into a real property asset transfer agreement with Revlon Holdings.\\nPursuant to such agreements, in June 1992, Revlon Holdings transferred certain assets to Products Corporation and Products\\nCorporation assumed all of the liabilities of Revlon Holdings, other than certain specifically excluded assets and liabilities (the\\nliabilities excluded are referred to as the \"Excluded Liabilities\"). Certain consumer products lines sold in demonstrator-assisted retailers\\nconsidered not integral to the Company\\'s business and that historically had not been profitable and certain other assets and liabilities\\nwere retained by Revlon Holdings. Revlon Holdings agreed to indemnify Revlon and Products Corporation against losses arising from\\nthe Excluded Liabilities, and Revlon and Products Corporation agreed to indemnify Revlon Holdings against losses arising from the\\nliabilities assumed by Products Corporation. The amounts reimbursed by Revlon Holdings to Products Corporation for the Excluded\\nLiabilities was $0.2\\xa0million for each of 2019 and 2018. As of both December\\xa031, 2019 and December\\xa031, 2018, a receivable balance of\\n$0.1 million from MacAndrews & Forbes was included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets for the Excluded Liabilities.\\nThe net activity related to transactions subject to the Transfer Agreements during 2019 and 2018 was $0.3\\xa0 million expense and\\n$0.9\\xa0million income, respectively.

MacAndrews & Forbes reimburses Products Corporation for the allocable costs of the services that Products\\nCorporation purchases for or provides to MacAndrews & Forbes and for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Products\\nCorporation in connection with the purchase or provision of such services. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and MacAndrews &\\nForbes, on the other, has agreed to indemnify the other party for losses arising out of the services provided by it under the\\nReimbursement Agreements, other than losses resulting from its willful misconduct or gross negligence.\\nThe Reimbursement Agreements may be terminated by either party on 90 days\\' notice. The Company does not intend to request\\nservices under the Reimbursement Agreements unless their costs would be at least as favorable to the Company as could be obtained\\nfrom unaffiliated third parties.\\nThe Company participates in MacAndrews & Forbes\\' directors and officers liability insurance program (the \"D&O Insurance\\nProgram\"), as well as its other insurance coverages, such as property damage, business interruption, liability and other coverages,\\nwhich cover the Company, as well as MacAndrews & Forbes and its subsidiaries. The limits of coverage for certain of the policies are\\navailable on an aggregate basis for losses to any or all of the participating companies and their respective directors and officers. The\\nCompany reimburses MacAndrews & Forbes from time-to-time for their allocable portion of the premiums for such coverage or the\\nCompany pays the insurers directly, which premiums the Company believes are more favorable than the premiums that the Company\\nwould pay were it to secure stand-alone coverage. Any amounts paid by the Company directly to MacAndrews & Forbes in respect of\\npremiums are included in the amounts paid under the Reimbursement Agreements.\\nThe net activity related to services purchased under the Reimbursement Agreements during 2019 and 2018 was $0.5 million\\nexpense and $0.6 million income, respectively. As of December\\xa031, 2019 and December\\xa031, 2018, a payable balance of $0.2 million to,\\nand a receivable balance of $0.3 million from, MacAndrews & Forbes, were included in the Company\\'s Consolidated Balance Sheet for\\ntransactions subject to the Reimbursement Agreements, respectively.\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n226/245'}\n",

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\\n2020 Refinancing Transactions\\nCommitted Debt Financing\\nOn March\\xa0 9, 2020, Products Corporation entered into a binding commitment letter (the “Commitment Letter”) with Jefferies\\nFinance LLC (the “Commitment Party”). Pursuant to the Commitment Letter and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein,\\nthe Commitment Party has committed to provide senior secured term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to\\n$850,000,000 (the “Facilities” and the “2020 Refinancing Transactions”).\\nThe proceeds of the Facilities will be used (i) to repay in full indebtedness outstanding under Products Corporation’s 5.75% Senior\\nNotes due February 2021 and Products Corporation’s Term Credit Agreement (the “2019 Term Loan Facility”) dated as of August 6,\\n2019 (the “Refinancing”), (ii) to pay fees and expenses in connection with the Facilities and the Refinancing and (iii) to the extent of\\nany excess, for general corporate purposes.\\nThe funding of the Facilities is contingent on the satisfaction of a limited number of customary conditions, including the execution\\nof definitive loan documentation for the Facilities, absence of material adverse change and certain other customary conditions. The\\ncommitments under the Commitment Letter will be available to the Company until June 30, 2020, unless the Refinancing (as defined\\nbelow) is consummated or the maturity of certain other material indebtedness of Products Corporation is accelerated prior to such date.\\nPrincipal and Maturity: The Facilities will consist of (i) a senior secured term loan facility in a principal amount of up to\\n$300,000,000 (the “Brandco Facility”) and (ii) a senior secured term loan facility in a principal amount of up to $550,000,000 (the\\n“Specified Brands Facility”). Jefferies Finance LLC will act as administrative agent and collateral agent in respect of the Facilities.\\nThe Facilities will mature on the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the Facilities (the “Closing Date”), subject to a springing\\nmaturity 91 days prior to the maturity date of Products Corporation’s 6.25% Senior Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) if, on such date,\\n$100,000,000 or more in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes remains outstanding.\\nBorrowers, Guarantees and Security:\\nBrandco Facility. The borrower under the Brandco Facility will be Products Corporation, and the Brandco Facility will be\\nguaranteed by certain indirect foreign subsidiaries of Products Corporation (the “Brandcos”), whose direct and indirect subsidiaries (the\\n“Specified Brands Subsidiaries”) will be “Unrestricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the existing debt agreements of Products\\nCorporation and will hold various intellectual property assets related to the Elizabeth Arden and American Crew brands and certain\\nother portfolio brands (the “Specified Brand Assets”). The Brandcos will not guarantee Products Corporation’s Term Credit Agreement\\ndated as of September 7, 2016 and amended to date (as amended to date, the “2016 Term Loan Facility”), but all guarantors of the 2016\\nTerm Loan Facility will guarantee the Brandco Facility. All of the assets of the Brandcos (including the equity of the first-tier Specified\\nBrands Subsidiary) will be pledged to secure the Brandco Facility on a first-priority basis and will not secure the 2016 Term Loan\\nFacility, but the Brandco Facility will be secured on a pari passu basis by the assets securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility.\\nSpecified Brands Facility. The borrower of the Specified Brands Facility will be a Specified Brands Subsidiary that is an indirect\\nsubsidiary of the Brandcos (the “Specified Brands Borrower”). The Specified Brands Facility will be guaranteed by the direct parent of\\nthe Specified Brands Borrower and each of the subsidiaries of the Specified Brands Borrower. The Specified Brands Facility will be\\nsecured by substantially all of the assets of the Specified Brands Borrower and the other Specified Brands Subsidiaries, which will\\ninclude the Specified Brand Assets.\\nContribution and License Agreements: In connection with the pledge of the Specified Brand Assets, Products Corporation will\\nenter into intercompany arrangements pursuant to which the Specified Brand Assets will be contributed to the Specified Brand\\nSubsidiaries. Products Corporation and/or its operating subsidiaries will enter into license and royalty arrangements on arm’s length\\nterms with the relevant Specified Brand Subsidiary to provide for their continued use of the Specified Brand Assets during the term of\\nthe Facilities.\\nInterest and Fees: Interest will accrue on the Facilities at a rate per annum of adjusted LIBOR plus a fixed margin. Products\\nCorporation is also obligated to pay customary fees and expenses in connection with the Facilities.\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n238/245'}\n",

The Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program includes rightsizing the organization and\\noperating with more efficient workflows and processes. The leaner organizational structure is also expected to improve communication\\nflow and cross-functional collaboration, leveraging the more efficient business processes.\\nAs a result of the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program, the Company expects to eliminate approximately 1,000 positions\\nworldwide, including approximately 650 current employees and approximately 350 open positions. In March 2020, the Company\\nbegan informing certain employees that will be affected by the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program. While certain aspects of the\\nRevlon 2020 Restructuring Program may be subject to consultations with employees, works councils, unions and/or governmental\\nauthorities, the Company currently expects to substantially complete the employee-related actions by the end of 2020 and the other\\nconsolidation and outsourcing actions during 2021 and 2022.\\nIn connection with implementing the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program, the Company expects to recognize during 2020\\napproximately $55\\xa0 million to $65\\xa0 million of total pre-tax restructuring and related charges (the “2020 Restructuring Charges”),\\nconsisting primarily of employee-related costs, such as severance, retention and other contractual termination benefits. In addition the\\nCompany expects, restructuring charges in the range of $65\\xa0million to $75\\xa0million to be charged and paid in the period of 2021 to 2022.\\nThe Company expects that substantially all of these restructuring charges will be paid in cash, with approximately $55\\xa0 million to\\n$65\\xa0million of the total charges expected to be paid in 2020, approximately $40\\xa0million to $45\\xa0million expected to be paid in 2021,\\nwith the balance expected to be paid in 2022.\\nAs a result of the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program, the Company expects to deliver in the range of $200\\xa0 million to\\n$230\\xa0million of annualized cost reductions by the end of 2022, with approximately 60% of these annualized cost reductions to be\\nrealized from the headcount reductions occurring in 2020. During 2020, the Company expects to realize approximately $105\\xa0million to\\n$115\\xa0million of in-year cost reductions.\\nF-80\\n3/7/25, 1:46 PM\\nrev-20191231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887921/000088792120000006/rev-20191231.htm\\n240/245'}\n",
